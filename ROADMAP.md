# Roadmap

The roadmap reflects what's shipped, what's in-flight, and what's planned. Open items are reordered each release based on community demand in [Discussions](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/discussions/categories/ideas).

## Where this is going (August 2026 direction review)

AquaScope is becoming **the open, continuously updated, citable record of the world's public water gauges, plus the zero-install place to look at them**; the Python library is the harvester and method engine underneath. Four layers, all on free infrastructure:

1. **The Archive** ([`Rekin226/aquascope-gauges`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rekin226/aquascope-gauges)): every station catalog as GeoParquet, daily observations mirrored per station for sources whose terms allow it, harvested weekly by CI, DuckDB-readable in place. [#188](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/188)
2. **The Explorer** ([live](https://rekin226-aquascope-explorer.static.hf.space/)): click any gauge on Earth (or anywhere at all) and get the record, flood frequency with confidence limits, flow duration, trend and citations, computed in your browser. [#189](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/189)
3. **The Analyst**: the same tools for assistants (`aquascope mcp`, [#113](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/113)) and for people who ask in plain language (`aquascope ask`), plus `aquascope ingest` for any agency export.
4. **Ecosystem**: the GeoLibre plugin (`integrations/geolibre`), QGIS/R readers of the archive, a data paper.

### Next: one platform (August 2026 direction pass)

The four layers exist. They are also four separate things to learn: the Explorer is a map with a scrolling panel, the Streamlit dashboard is a different app with different methods and no gauges, and the Analyst answers two-tool questions well and complex ones not at all. The next arc merges them into **one zero-install app, GIS-grade, with the Python engine running in a browser worker**: the map is one mode, a workbench (your own data, plus the dashboard's methods) is another, and the Analyst is a drawer that keeps context across both. One engine, three faces: every capability stays a plain Python function in the package, and the web app, the MCP server and the CLI are thin faces over it.

Most of that arc shipped between 18 and 20 August 2026 and is live in the Explorer; what is left is listed under it.

- [x] The app's shell, information architecture and UX: tabbed inspector, Ask beside the station, URL-as-state, search, mobile, export, "cite this" ([#231](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/231), [#238](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/pull/238)). Still open there: an OG image, i18n, and a focus-management and screen-reader pass
- [x] Layers v1: eight keyless basemaps, Sentinel-2 cloudless, 3D terrain and a globe, six NASA GIBS and ESA rasters on a shared date control, gauge colouring and a density heat map, area select to CSV ([#232](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/232), [#241](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/pull/241)). Still open there: BasinATLAS choropleths, COG climatologies, and measure and draw
- [x] Try the AI without a key: recorded showcase replays that re-run their tools live, a model on your device (Chrome's Prompt API or WebLLM) with a reduced tool set, and one provider registry ([#233](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/233), [#242](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/pull/242), [#248](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/pull/248))
- [x] The Analyst, level 3: a `run_python` sandbox with the data on screen in scope, deterministic checks printed as "what this answer does not establish", and every answer as a re-runnable `study.yaml` that `aquascope run` executes with no model in the loop ([#234](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/234), [#246](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/pull/246), closing the runner half of [#54](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/54))
- [x] Workbench: sixteen analyses as plain functions in `aquascope/workbench.py`, a My data mode in the app with ingest and a QA report, and the public Streamlit deployments retired ([#235](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/235), [#244](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/pull/244), [#245](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/pull/245))
- [x] WebMCP tools in the page and an MCP Apps view for `aquascope mcp` ([#236](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/236), [#248](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/pull/248))
- [x] The Analyst, level 4 (September 2026): reconnaissance before analysis (`assess_site` and the method-precondition registry, [#306](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/306)), studies as plans with per-step gates and a fallback runner, playbooks as data with three exemplars ([#307](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/307)), a team of roles (Scout, Coordinator, Specialist, Reviewer, Narrator) behind `aquascope solve` and the Explorer's Solve mode ([#308](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/308)), the full record by default ([#270](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/270)), Claude as a provider ([#322](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/322)). Seven playbooks (flood risk, ungauged flow, groundwater decline, drought status, supply reliability, irrigation feasibility, water quality) and the on-device model reading Solve's intake followed. Still open there: a climate-scaling playbook (needs CMIP6 output the user supplies), the Kc tables of the 2025 FAO-56 revision (#310)
- [x] HydroGym Phase 1: tasks generated from the playbooks with unsolvable ones and a held-out split, a bench for the tree, the team and the Ask loop, a leaderboard with cost, and a first 12-task smoke on Claude Sonnet 5 ([#175](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/175)). Still open: the 60-task suite, small and keyless rows, the test split at scale, a DOI for the task suite
- [x] Studio (September 2026): a crew of roles over one workspace that does a complete study at any place with any data and reports it like an engineer. The Consultant writes the brief (at most three questions), the Scout the data inventory, the Methodologist composes the methodology from the method catalogue and has every step validated against the registry, the Analysts run it with gates and draw the figures as results land, the Critic checks the draft, the Author assembles Word, Markdown, HTML, Excel, PNG and SVG figures, a reproducing notebook and study.yaml in one zip; keyless every role has a deterministic behaviour and the bundle is still produced. `aquascope studio`, `aquascope.studio.Studio`, the `studio_*` MCP tools and the Explorer's Study mode, which replaces Solve in the drawer ([#350](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/350), #351 to #356). Still open there: a HydroGym task family that scores the Methodologist's plans against expert plans, flood-extent and climate-scaling methods (#329, #330), a Space showcase of recorded studies

## Major features — leveling up

Ambitious, high-impact work that takes AquaScope to the next level. These are [`major feature`](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/labels/major%20feature) · `help wanted` — larger than a weekend, mentorship available. Comment on the issue to discuss scope before starting.

- [ ] Archive Phase 3: reservoir storage and water-quality variables, more agencies with a `stations()` catalog (Australia BOM, Taiwan WRA), a data paper ([#188](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/188))
- [ ] Explorer Phase 3: GR4J calibrated in the page shipped (JS port + differential evolution, ~2 s for 40 years); still open here: agency catchment boundaries under open licences (UK NRFA), sub-daily where terms allow ([#189](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/189)). The shell and UX rebuild is [#231](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/231), the map layers [#232](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/232)

_(#41 colorblind palette and #42 baseflow edge-case tests — ✅ shipped.)_

**Ready for more?** The [`good second issue`](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/labels/good%20second%20issue) tier: Mann-Kendall trend test + Sen's slope ([#44](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/44)), flow-duration-curve slope + runoff ratio ([#45](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/45)), Dashboard Groundwater page ([#125](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/125)), SPI unification ([#127](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/127)), and the CAMELS-BR collector ([#124](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/124)).

**Prefer hunting bugs?** Two real, reproducible ones are open: GEV flood-frequency confidence intervals blow up on typical record lengths ([#119](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/119)) and the keyless USGS quickstart path fails ([#120](https://github.com/Rekin226/aquascope/issues/120)).
