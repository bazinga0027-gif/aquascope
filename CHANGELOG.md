# Changelog

All notable changes to AquaScope are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **South Africa DWS Verified Hydrology collector** (#20). Adds verified daily mean river discharge and point water-level collection through the deterministic `HyData.aspx` interface, normalised to `StreamflowReading` and `WaterLevelReading`. The collector validates the response body because DWS can return a Kisters `ScriptServerODBC` backend failure with HTTP 200, and fails closed rather than representing that page as hydrological data.
- **Studio: a crew that does a complete study at any place, with any data, and reports it like an engineer** (#350). `aquascope studio "PROBLEM" --lat --lon [--data FILE ...] [--provider ...] --out DIR` runs seven roles over one shared workspace: the Consultant turns the words, the site and the attached tables into a brief (at most three questions; "just go" proceeds on stated assumptions), the Scout builds the data inventory (gauges, wells and rain gauges with their true spans, the catchment, donors, the ERA5 cell, the user's tables through `ingest` with their QA verdict), the Methodologist composes the methodology from the method catalogue (every Analyst tool, workbench analysis and problem-level function, with what each yields and the gates that fit) and has every step checked against the catalogue and the method registry before the user sees it (one repair round, then the playbook tree, then a decline with the reasons), the Analysts run it with the version-2 runner and its gates and draw the figures as results land, the Critic runs the deterministic checks and one independent model pass, the Author assembles the report, and the Coordinator keeps the state machine, the events and the checkpoint (`workspace.json`, resumable in the CLI, the browser and over MCP). The user is in the loop twice: the brief and the plan; follow-ups after the report are answered from the workspace or planned, run and re-authored on the same study. Keyless, every role has a deterministic behaviour (the keyword rules, the playbook tree, template prose) and the bundle is still produced; with a key each role makes stateless calls with compact JSON, never a transcript (a Sonnet 5 study runs at roughly 80k tokens). Python: `aquascope.studio.Studio` (`say`, `approve`, `follow_up`, `export`, `to_dict`, `from_dict`); MCP: `studio_start`, `studio_say`, `studio_approve`, `studio_follow_up`, `studio_export`; `examples/langgraph_team.py --studio` and `examples/crewai_studio.py` map the roles onto those frameworks without making either a dependency. Docs: `docs/studio.md`, `docs/studio-design.md`. (#351, #352, #353, #355)
- **The bundle** (#354). `aquascope/studio/deliverables/`: PNG and SVG figures with captions drawn from the result kind (the record with its annual maxima, the frequency curve with the bootstrap band and the spread across fits, flow duration, the trend, SPI and SPEI strips, propagation to the SGI, donors, transferred signatures with their band, the monthly climate, reliability, crop demand, the site map, samples, WHO exceedances, WQI, baseflow, recharge), CSV tables, an Excel workbook (README, inventory, plan, gates, one sheet per table, a figure index, the ledger), the report as Word, Markdown and self-contained HTML (summary and key numbers, problem and decision, site and data, methodology, results per step, limitations and what the study does not establish, recommendations, references, a reproducibility appendix), a notebook that re-runs the study, `study.yaml`, `workspace.json`, one zip. New extra `aquascope[studio]` (matplotlib, openpyxl, python-docx); the Word file is skipped with a note when python-docx is absent. All pure Python, so the same bundle is built inside the Explorer's browser worker.
- **Study version 3.** The version-2 shape plus the plan's objective, methodology, assumptions, alternatives and expected limitations, and each step's expected outputs; `aquascope run` replays it with no model in the loop.
- **Explorer: Study replaces Solve in the drawer** (#356). Ask | Study: a conversation with a study board above the input that shows one thing at a time (the brief and the Consultant's questions as chips, the plan with Approve, Edit and Decline, the run with its timeline and the figures as they are drawn, the answer with the key numbers, the figure gallery and the bundle to download, then a follow-up box). "Study this place" on every gauge and point panel opens it with the site set; a CSV or XLSX can be dropped in and the table open in My data is offered; `#study=1` restores the drawer (`#solve=` still opens it). The worker runs the same engine through a `studio` message with the workspace travelling in and out and the figures posted as they land; matplotlib, openpyxl and python-docx load only when a study runs, so the first visit is unchanged. Donor steps run in the browser too: the page hands the worker the station catchments and signatures it already reads with DuckDB (the roughly 800 stations with archived signatures), and `similar_for_point` and `regionalize_point` take the catchment description the page built instead of opening BasinATLAS. Verified headless: a keyless flood study at Kingston to the zip in 22 s, an ungauged study at a bare point with the donors map and the transferred signatures, an uploaded CSV studied, a follow-up replanned, zero console errors.
- **Flood fits report the return period the study asks for.** `analyze_station`, `flood_frequency` and `flood_ci` take `return_periods` (the default list stays 2 to 100 years); the Analyst tools expose it; the Studio runner adds the brief's return period to every flood step, so a 200-year design no longer fails the gates for want of a 200 in the list.
- **CLI results can be saved as JSON or CSV** (#27). `aquascope recommend`, every `aquascope hydro` analysis, and `aquascope agri plan` now share `--output/-o` and `--format`; when `--format` is omitted, a `.csv` suffix selects CSV and other suffixes select JSON.
- **Explorer: discharge can be displayed in ft³/s (cfs)** (#316). A "Show ft³/s" button in the station header converts the KPIs, hydrograph, flood-frequency table and chart, flow-duration curve, trend slope and GR4J plot at render time. The choice persists in localStorage. Everything internal is untouched: the worker, the model and the CSV downloads stay in the agency's unit.
- The showcase and repair workflows accept `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (and `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID`) as repository secrets, so both can run on Claude (#325).
- Add FAO-56 crop coefficient and growth-stage data for millet, cassava, and chickpea (#21).

### Changed
- `Study.to_dict()` keeps the study's version (2 or 3) instead of always writing 2.
- Solve's keyword rules read an abstraction to be met on a share of days as a supply question, not an ungauged-flow one.
- **The Environment Agency is labelled England, not UK** (#320), in the Explorer, the registry, the README and the docs tables. The EA is England's public body; Scotland (SEPA, #317), Wales (NRW) and Northern Ireland (DfI Rivers, #318) are separate agencies.

### Fixed
- **Custom water quality guidelines are validated before scoring** (#343). Unsupported parameters, missing or non-finite bounds, and inverted ranges now fail with clear `ValueError`s instead of reaching the scoring arithmetic.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added
- **HydroGym Phase 1 at scale: the 60-task suite of 2026-09-03** (#175). `aquascope gym tasks` samples stations still listed as open (an open catalog end runs to today, as the reconnaissance reads it), which brings the French hydrometry gauges and most Environment Agency stations into the suite; a site whose reconnaissance fails, or a task whose key the tree cannot compute, is skipped and reported. `aquascope gym bench` gains `--resume` and `--spread`, prints the spend so far, counts timeouts in their own column and prices a timed-out row at zero. The ask agent's refusal is read by `read_refusal` (explicit refusals only; the stem "declin" no longer counts, since on the groundwater playbook it is the finding) and `rescore_ask` re-reads stored rows when the lists change. `assess_site` lists the station each variable's span came from even beyond the nearest 25, so a playbook that selects a branch on the context can always resolve its station (this crashed the tree at dense UK sites). Results, 15 sites and 60 tasks with 6 sites held out, 4.57 USD at list prices: the team matched every key with Claude Sonnet 5 (6,575 tokens a task) and all but one with Claude Haiku 4.5, the keyless tree and team matched every key at no cost, and the old Ask loop matched 68 percent with 16 percent false declines at 30,810 tokens a task. Leaderboard, discussion and a Zenodo deposit package under `aquascope/gym/results/2026-09-03/` and `docs/hydrogym.md`.
- **SPEI next to SPI** (#309). `standardized_precipitation_evapotranspiration_index` in `aquascope.climate.indices` (log-logistic fit on the climatic water balance, Vicente-Serrano et al. 2010, sharing the SPI core) with a monthly Thornthwaite PET helper from temperature, so it runs on the ERA5 temperature `anywhere()` returns; a `spei` workbench analysis and the drought challenge path.
- **Four more playbooks** (#307): `drought_status` (SPI and SPEI at a gauge or the ERA5 cell at 1, 3 and 12 months with their divergence, the SGI and its lag behind SPI at a well, the low-flow context at a river; declines flash-drought questions, which need a sub-monthly index), `supply_reliability` (run-of-river screening of a stated demand against the flow-duration curve with Q95 kept in the river, at a gauge or from regionalized signatures; declines reservoir schemes), `irrigation_feasibility` (the crop's seasonal demand from FAO-56 single Kc on ERA5 ET0, then the supply screening where a gauge is within reach; the Kc tables await the 2025 revision, #310), and `water_quality` (below). Solve's keyword rules and intake hints cover them; `explorer/playbooks.json` carries all seven.
- **Water Quality Index, CCME and NSF, and an irrigation suitability index** (#62). `aquascope.analysis.water_quality`: `wqi_ccme` (CCME WQI 1.0 over an explicit guideline table; the CCME manual's North Saskatchewan example reproduces to 88, Good), `wqi_nsf` (the nine Brown et al. 1970 parameters with digitised sub-index curves, stand-ins declared) and `iwqi` (Ayers and Westcot 1985: SAR, sodium percentage, RSC and the FAO 29 restriction). Three shipped guideline sets (WHO 2022 drinking water, FAO 29 irrigation, CCME aquatic life), one parameter vocabulary (`aquascope.utils.parameters`) with unit conversions that the WHO screen now reads too, workbench analyses `wqi` and `iwqi`, a `water_quality_samples` tool (USGS daily values and Water Quality Portal samples) for the Analyst, MCP and studies, and a `min_samples` gate.
- **Playbook `water_quality`** (#62, #307): intake `use` (drinking, irrigation, aquatic life), `years`, `health_verdict`; branches per use over samples, the WHO screen and the indices against the use's guidelines; declines when no sampled parameters are within reach (the archive carries none until Phase 3, #188) and when asked for a health verdict beyond the sampled parameters. Verified live on the Potomac: a conductivity-only monitor stops the study with the reason; Little Falls passes 4 of 4 gates.
- **Explorer: Solve reads a sentence on the reader's device.** With no chip chosen and no key, the words in the What stage go to Chrome's built-in model (when it is already on the machine) or the WebLLM engine Ask loaded, as one schema-constrained call; the reply is made safe by the package's own rules (`aquascope.playbooks.coerce_intake`, via a new `coerce_intake` worker message), the chip is preselected and the fields filled, and Plan continues. Without a model on the device the keyword rules read the words as before and one line under the plan says so. Solve never starts a model download. Intake fields take optional `min`/`max`.
- **The team from LangGraph or your own orchestrator.** `examples/langgraph_team.py` runs the same roles as a LangGraph `StateGraph` (scout, plan, review as an interrupt, run, report) with no new dependency in the package; `docs/solve.md` maps roles to nodes for LangGraph and CrewAI-style stacks.
- **HydroGym Phase 1: a verifiable benchmark of hydrology agents on real sites, generated from the playbooks** (#175). `aquascope gym tasks --n 60 --out tasks.jsonl` samples catalog sites across sources and continents (long and short gauges, wells, bare points kept on land), runs the reconnaissance once per site and, for every playbook, the tree alone: the branch it selects, the gates it expects and the tools it calls are the scoring key, and a task the playbook declines is unsolvable (data-driven declines, plus probes read off each playbook's intake-only decline rules such as an inundation map or a cause to attribute). One site in four is held out by a hash of the site. `aquascope gym bench --tasks tasks.jsonl --agent tree|team|ask [--provider --model --limit N --unsolvable K --timeout]` plays an agent per task and records branch match, the fraction of expected gates evaluated, tools called, a decline on unsolvable tasks, an answer present, tokens (per role for the team), seconds and errors; `aquascope gym leaderboard results/*.jsonl --out leaderboard.md` aggregates any number of result files with a cost estimate from a small list-price table. `ask()` reports its token usage (`AskResult.usage`) and takes a `context_chars` cap. Docs: `docs/hydrogym.md`, with the first 12-task, 8-run smoke on Claude Sonnet 5 under `aquascope/gym/results/2026-09-02/`: the team matched every scoring key on 6,437 tokens a task where the old Ask loop matched two thirds on 62,314.
- **Explorer: Solve.** A Solve button beside Ask opens the same drawer in a second mode: pick a place on the map, choose a problem (the playbooks, with their intake fields) or say it in your words, see what the record supports, review the plan as a numbered checklist with its gates (edit the arguments if you like), watch it run with a check after every step, and read the answer next to what it does not establish, the caveats, Data and Methods, and the study.yaml that reproduces it. Keyless end to end; the key Ask holds is offered for the prose. `#solve=<playbook>` restores the drawer. (`aquascope.ai_engine.team.run_reviewed`, `run_study(tools=...)`, `aquascope.archive.basins.describe_catchment_from_row`, `python -m aquascope.playbooks`)
- **Studies as plans: version 2 with gates** (#308). A step carries an id, a rationale, gates (`expects`), a fallback and `depends_on`; `aquascope run` evaluates the gates after each step, runs the fallback once or stops with the reason, prints every gate outcome and writes the results back into the study. Version-1 studies run unchanged. The check vocabulary lives in `aquascope/gates.py` (`min_years`, `max_return_period_factor`, `ci_finite`, `spread_within`, `nse_min`, `kge_min`, `not_empty`, `unit_present`, `max_area_km2`, `min_donors`, `status_is`) with dotted paths, list indexes and `[key=value]` selectors.
- **Playbooks, the method-selection scaffold as data** (#307). `aquascope/playbooks/*.yaml` with three exemplars (`flood_risk`, `ungauged_flow`, `groundwater_decline`): intake fields, branches chosen by conditions over the reconnaissance, study-v2 steps with gates, declines and caveats printed verbatim, citations. `plan(playbook, recon, intake)` fills a runnable study with zero model calls, and a step's method is checked against the registry at plan time (the #273 GR4J case is refused before it runs). `aquascope playbooks [list | show ID]`.
- **The plan-first Analyst, a team of roles** (#308). `aquascope solve "PROBLEM" --lat --lon` runs Scout, Coordinator, Reviewer, Specialist and Narrator as stateless subcalls over one study: keyless it makes no model call at all; a key adds a rationale, one replan after a failed gate, and prose. The report lists the plan, every gate outcome, what the answer does not establish, and the playbook's caveats. The plan is shown and confirmed before anything runs. MCP tools `list_playbooks`, `describe_playbook`, `solve_plan`, `solve_run`, and the same four in `aquascope ask` so a question that is a problem at a place can be handed to Solve. Docs: `docs/solve.md`, `docs/solve-design.md`.
- **Reconnaissance before analysis: `assess_site`** (#306). `aquascope.explore.assess_site(lat, lon)` inventories the gauges within reach from the published catalog (true record spans, no agency call), the BasinATLAS catchment and the donors a similarity search offers, and returns the sufficiency table from `aquascope.methods`: for every method, defensible, marginal or not defensible here, with the reason and the station it would use, plus honest notes (daily resolution assumed, sources that publish only the last month, short or ended records). Exposed as `aquascope assess LAT LON [--problem] [--radius-km] [--return-period]`, the `assess_site` MCP tool, an Analyst tool the model calls first for any place or station (it will not run a method the table marks not defensible), and a collapsed "What can be answered here" card in the Explorer's point and station panels.
- **The method-precondition registry** (`aquascope/methods.py`): what each method needs before its answer is worth quoting (variable, record length as defensible / marginal / not, resolution, a catchment ceiling for lumped models, a return-period cap relative to record length, donors, other inputs), as data with citations; `assess_method` and `sufficiency_table` turn a site into plain-words verdicts. The design of the whole Solve arc is in `docs/solve-design.md`.
- **Anthropic as a provider for the Analyst** (#322). `aquascope ask --provider anthropic` (or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment, now first in the scan order) runs the same tool loop on Claude, `claude-opus-5` by default with Sonnet 5 and Haiku 4.5 in the picker. The Messages API is a different protocol from chat completions, so `aquascope.ai_engine.llm_transport.AnthropicChatClient` translates both ways behind the surface the loop already uses: system messages, `input_schema` tools, `tool_result` blocks (all of a turn's results in one message), and the model's own content blocks replayed on every assistant turn so adaptive thinking survives tool calls. The `anthropic` SDK is used when installed and not in a browser; the Explorer's worker posts to `/v1/messages` directly with the header Anthropic requires from a page. The registry gained `api` (the wire protocol) and `context_chars` (how much conversation the loop may keep before trimming; 200k for Anthropic, so tool results stop being cut to 400 characters), `--provider` choices in `ask` and `ingest` now come from the registry, and "prompt is too long" is treated like any other too-large request. `AQUASCOPE_LLM_EFFORT` passes `output_config.effort` through, and `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID` becomes the `anthropic-workspace-id` header that identity-linked keys spanning several workspaces require.
- **`ReportBuilder` can cite the software that produced the report** (#334). `ReportMetadata` gains optional `doi` and `citation` fields plus a `software_version` that defaults to `aquascope.__version__`, and `ReportBuilder.add_software_citation()` renders a "Cite this software" section. A verbatim `citation` is used as given; otherwise one is built from the author, year and software version, with the DOI resolved to a `https://doi.org/...` URL when set and an explicit "DOI not yet assigned" when not. The section is built from the same heading and paragraph elements as the rest of a report, so it renders in both `to_markdown()` and `to_html()`. `version` still identifies the report and keeps its `"1.0"` default.
- **NVIDIA Build provider support** (#331). Added NVIDIA Build (`https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`) to `aquascope.ai_engine.providers` with default model `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, support for `nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct`, `NVIDIA_API_KEY` credential scanning in `ENV_SCAN_ORDER`, documentation in `docs/analyst.md`, and unit test coverage in `tests/test_ai_engine/test_providers.py`.

### Changed
- **The full record by default** (#270). The Explorer, the MCP server and the Analyst now request a station's whole record, from the catalog's first date when it is known, instead of the last 40 years; `years` is an explicit cap, the CWA CODIS fetch keeps its 10-year cap and says so, and the fetch note states what was requested and where the served record actually starts when the agency serves less than the catalog lists. The harvest follows the same default.
- `CITATION.cff` lists the v0.13.0 version DOI `10.5281/zenodo.22152064` (concept DOI unchanged).
- **WQP collector moved to the WQX 3.0 API** (#170). The old WQX 2.2 endpoint missed USGS data after 2024-03-11. `fetch_raw` now calls `/wqx3/Result/search` with `dataProfile=narrow`; a clean break from 2.2 — only WQX 3.0 field names are read (cross-walked from the official schema, e.g. `ResultMeasureValue` to `Result_Measure`, `CharacteristicName` to `Characteristic_Name`, `MonitoringLocationIdentifier` to `Location_Identifier`), with no dual-version support.

### Fixed
- **Multi-word catalog searches** (#306). `find_stations(query="Kingston Thames")` returned nothing: the whole string was one substring tested against the name alone. Several words now match across name, id and river, accent-folded and case-insensitive ("Thames at Kingston", "Rhône Anthon"), with a ranked fallback to the best partial matches; single-word queries behave as before.
- **Answer checks misread ranges and labels** (#324). The number check no longer reads the dash of a range as a minus sign ("297-348" gave -348) nor glues a label's digits onto the next number ("Q2 325" gave 2325); real negatives such as skew = -0.864 still parse. The Analyst is also told not to add site facts from memory unless labelled "from general knowledge, not from the data", and a new `years_traceable` check lists any year in the answer that no tool result contains.
- **`flood_analysis()` reduces daily input to annual maxima for Gumbel and GEV L-moments** (#333). `aquascope.api.flood_analysis()` documents `discharge` as a daily or sub-daily series, but `method="gumbel"` and `method="gev_lmoments"` passed it straight to `fit_gumbel()` / `fit_gev_lmoments()`, whose first parameter is `annual_maxima` and which treat every value as one. A six-year daily record was therefore fitted as ~2,200 annual maxima, so the return levels described the distribution of daily flows rather than of annual floods (a nominal Q100 of 90.6 against 125.8 once fitted correctly). Both methods now resample to annual maxima the way `gev` and `lp3` already did, so the quantity fitted no longer depends on which distribution is chosen; input without a `DatetimeIndex` is still passed through untouched, since it is already annual maxima. `gpd` is unaffected — it takes peaks over a threshold by design.
- Taiwan data.gov.tw collection now uses the WRA-hosted UUID datasets with strict TLS verification, preserves legacy numeric dataset IDs, and returns the complete response unless a client requests a limit.
- **GEMStat collector validates Zenodo payload before caching** (#172). When Zenodo returned an HTML interstitial, error, or non-zip stream, `fetch_raw` previously wrote the body directly into `data/cache/gemstat_<hash>.zip`, causing `zipfile.BadZipFile` on every subsequent fetch due to persistent cache poisoning. `fetch_raw` now resolves the download URL from `links.content` or `links.self`, streams to a `.tmp` file, validates that the `Content-Type` is not HTML and the initial bytes start with `PK` zip magic bytes, and cleans up temporary or corrupt cache files on failure so non-zip payloads raise diagnostic errors instead of unhandled exceptions.
- **Format p-values consistently across CLI and dashboard** (#303). `cli.py` and `dashboard/views/extremes.py` previously formatted p-values with `:.4f` and `:.3f`, allowing non-zero values (e.g. `p = 1e-12`) to print as `0.0000` or `0.000` and appear as exactly zero. Added a shared `format_p_value` helper in `aquascope.utils.formatting` following the Explorer's convention (`"< 0.001"` floor, three decimals otherwise, and `"—"` for non-finite/null values) and updated both call sites.
- **TLS verification failures against `iot.wra.gov.tw` and `opendata.wra.gov.tw`** (#169). Both hosts chain to a TWCA-issued certificate missing the Subject Key Identifier extension, which Python 3.13+ rejects under its default strict profile (`SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED, Missing Subject Key Identifier`). `taiwan_wra_iot.py` and the `WRA_BASE` clients in `taiwan_wra.py` (water level, reservoir, groundwater, well-metadata) now use `relax_strict_tls=True` — already established for `codis.cwa.gov.tw` (#177) — which drops only that strict-profile check while keeping full chain and hostname verification on; this also replaces `verify=False`, which had been disabling verification outright. `taiwan_wra_iot.py` is also rewired to the v2 API's actual `groundwaterlevel/stations` endpoint and response shape (the old guessed v1-style paths all 404); rainfall is no longer offered for this source since the v2 API gates it behind paid membership with no free endpoint.
- **GEV bootstrap discard tracking and Mann-Kendall p-value formatting** (#272): `FloodFreqResult` now exposes `n_bootstrap` and `n_bootstrap_discarded` counts when bootstrap confidence intervals are computed, surfacing when parameter bounds ($|c| \le 0.50$) discard resamples. The counts are threaded through `aquascope.explore`, `aquascope.workbench`, and the MCP server. In the Explorer, the Floods panel renders a footer caveat when $\ge 5\%$ of resamples are discarded, and Mann-Kendall trend p-values are formatted with `fmtP` (reporting `< 0.001` instead of `p = 0` for tiny p-values).
- **WQP no longer downloads the whole state** (#170). `/Result/search` returns CSV with no server-side row cap, so a state query buffered hundreds of MB (317 MB / 452 s / 836k rows) before `max_results` was applied. `fetch_raw` now streams the response off the underlying httpx transport and stops reading once `max_results` rows are seen, so a query downloads only the window it needs.
- **WQP failures are loud instead of silent empties** (#170). The old collector caught every error and returned `[]`, so a slow or dead endpoint looked like a genuine "no data" response. Errors now log descriptively and re-raise, and the client uses a payload-appropriate 600 second timeout; now, only a genuine empty body returns `[]`. Where streaming transport is unavailable, it warns that streaming is off and falls back to a buffered request.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- **BOM (Australia) station catalog**: `BOMCollector.stations()` (#208). BOM's KiWIS `getStationList` returns real coordinates for most rows but leaves `parametertype_name` blank on ~76% of an unfiltered response, so the catalog issues one request per BOM parameter type and merges by `station_no`, folding each type into the shared registry vocabulary (`discharge`, `water_level`, `reservoir_storage`, `groundwater_level`, `precipitation`, `water_quality`). A live check also turned up coordinates for a meaningful slice of stations (mostly groundwater bores and small telemetry sites) that are simply wrong at the source — sign-flipped longitudes, an unset-location sentinel clustering near `lat=-85.5`, or literal `(0, 0)` — so `stations()` validates against `AU_SANITY_BBOX` and drops those rather than returning them as real gauge locations.
- **The Explorer is a map again** (#281). The old shell put the rail, the map, the inspector and the Analyst in one flex row, so the map was the only element that could give ground: at 1,280 px with the Analyst open it was a 208 px strip, and on a laptop it never had more than half the window. Now the map fills the window and everything else floats over it as a card, so the map is the first and largest thing on screen at every size and opening a panel never shrinks it. The layer rail is closed on arrival and grouped behind five headings (sources, basemap, relief, overlays, credits) instead of forty controls stacked in a column; the eight basemaps are a swatch grid rather than eight radio rows; the inspector folds away with one click; and on a phone it is a bottom sheet over a full-screen map rather than a map squeezed into 42 % of the height. The world view is a **globe**: coverage is worldwide and sparse, so Mercator spent its pixels on Greenland and the poles, and MapLibre eases the globe back to Mercator by about zoom 5 where the work happens. There is a projection button on the map, and `gl=0` in a link keeps a flat map. Relief (hillshade) is on by default, because the light basemap on its own is near-white land on pale water. In search results a station's name no longer loses half its row to the Environment Agency's UUID ids. (#281)
- CI: a Pyodide/WASM smoke job builds the wheel, installs it under Pyodide and runs `analyze_series`, the dashboard import and the Emscripten HTTP path, so a dependency that stops being browser-installable fails CI instead of the live demo. Runs on PRs touching `aquascope/`, `explorer/` or `pyproject.toml`, plus a weekly canary. (#114)
- The showcase records incrementally. Eight questions cost roughly a free tier's entire daily token budget, so a run that exhausts it used to lose everything and start again next time. A run now skips examples that are already recorded and still fresh (`--refresh-after`, 30 days), republishes them alongside whatever it manages this time, and the job seeds itself from the open recordings branch. A half-finished set fills in over successive runs instead of resetting. (#233)
- **A social preview card, and the keyboard and screen-reader pass** (#231 follow-ups): a link to the Explorer previewed as a blank rectangle, because the page promised `twitter:card=summary_large_image` and declared no image. `explorer/make_og_image.py` draws one from the catalog the site actually serves (every gauge as a dot, which is a world map made only of places someone measures water), and `build.py` now copies binary assets so it ships. On the keyboard: opening the Ask drawer, the modal or the mobile rail moves focus into it, Escape closes it, and closing returns focus to the control that opened it; the modal traps Tab, which is what `aria-modal="true"` had been promising. `explorer/src/a11y.js` also adds one polite live region, so a card that reports "failed, retry" says it to a screen reader and not only on screen.
- **The Analyst reaches level 3** (#234): `run_python` lets it write a short snippet against aquascope, the workbench, pandas and numpy with the data on screen in scope, for the questions no fixed tool covers (imports are allow-listed and the usual escape hatches refused; the sandbox module is explicit that the platform, not the check, is the boundary). Deterministic checks now run over the answer and the results behind it (every number appears in a tool result, a return level carries its interval, a significance claim matches the p-value, units and the record are named), and unmet ones are printed under the answer as "what this answer does not establish". Every answer also comes with the steps that produced it: `aquascope ask --study study.yaml`, then `aquascope run study.yaml` re-runs them with no model in the loop and writes a report, a results file and a manifest that hashes each step so a drifting re-run is visible. That is #54's declarative runner, and `aquascope run` now takes either a study file or the old `--method`/`--file` pipeline.
- **Ask without a key** (#233): the Ask panel used to open on a credentials form, so most visitors never saw what the Analyst does. It now opens on three tiers. **Worked examples**: eight real questions (a flood curve at Kingston, Q95 on the Seine and the Loire, a Potomac trend, Taipei against London, boreholes near Cambridge, an ungauged Portuguese river, a catchment description, a flood against its donors) recorded once a week by CI with the maintainer's key and replayed in the page, with every tool call, the Data and Methods sections and the checks; "run the tools again" re-runs the deterministic half live in the reader's browser, so only the prose is a recording and the page says so. **On your device**: where the browser has Chrome's built-in Prompt API, or the reader chooses to download a small WebLLM model over WebGPU, Ask runs with no key and no server on a reduced tool set, and labels itself that way rather than pretending to be the full Analyst. **Your own key**, unchanged, for the full loop. `python -m aquascope.showcase` records the traces; `.github/workflows/showcase.yml` publishes them, and says so politely and stops when no key is configured.
- **Tools for an agent in the browser, and a view inside the chat** (#236): where the browser supports WebMCP (`navigator.modelContext`), the Explorer registers `find_stations`, `analyze_station`, `anywhere`, `describe_catchment` and `show_on_map`, so an assistant in the same browser can query the world's gauges without aquascope being installed anywhere; it is entirely feature-detected, so nothing changes where the API is absent. The MCP server gains `station_view`, which returns the ordinary `analyze_station` result plus a small HTML view (a dependency-free inline hydrograph, the headline numbers and the attribution) for clients that support the MCP Apps extension.
- **Places in the search box** (#231 follow-up): "Blois" or "Taipei" now find the town as well as the gauge, through Photon (keyless, and its terms allow autocomplete, which OSM's own Nominatim does not). Picking a place opens the climate, catchment and nearest gauges for that spot.
- **The Workbench in the Explorer** (#235): a "My data" mode where you drop a CSV or an Excel export (or paste a table, or send the gauge you are looking at) and the analyses run on it in your browser. `aquascope.ingest` works out which column is the date and which is the value, converts to SI and shows a QA report; the page then offers the workbench analyses by tab (Quality, Hydrology, Extremes, Groundwater) with their own parameter controls, charts, JSON download and accumulated methods and citations. Nothing is uploaded: the file is read in the tab.
- **`aquascope.workbench`**: the analyses behind the dashboard's pages as plain functions that take a DataFrame and return a JSON-serialisable dict, so the same code runs in the browser (Pyodide), in the MCP server, in the Analyst's tool loop, in the CLI and behind Streamlit. Sixteen analyses: exploratory summary, quality report, preprocessing, insights, the WHO drinking-water screen, flow-duration curve, baseflow separation (Lyne-Hollick, Eckhardt, UKIH), recession, GEV flood frequency, flow signatures, return periods (GEV/LP3/Gumbel with confidence limits and the empirical points), FAO-56 reference ET0 and irrigation scheduling, the standardised groundwater index with drought events, water-table-fluctuation recharge, and Theis drawdown. Each result carries its methods and citations. The three column-detection rules the dashboard had grown are one resolver (`pick_column`, with `prefer="discharge" | "level" | "value"`), and the dashboard now calls into the module instead of keeping its own copy. New MCP and Analyst tools `list_analyses` and `analyse_table(csv, analysis, params)` put all of it in reach of an assistant. (#235)
- **Layers v1 in the Explorer** (#232): the map now has a layer stack instead of one hard-coded basemap. Eight basemaps (OpenFreeMap light, dark and streets; Sentinel-2 cloudless 2016 and 2025; EOX Terrain Light; NASA GIBS VIIRS true colour for a chosen day; USGS imagery for the United States), 3D terrain, hillshade and a globe toggle from the AWS Terrain Tiles DEM, and six environmental overlays with opacity sliders and their own colour scales: GPM IMERG precipitation rate, SMAP root-zone soil moisture, MODIS snow cover, MODIS land surface temperature, GRACE water storage anomaly and ESA WorldCover land cover. The time-driven layers share one date control, so you can walk a flood or a snowmelt day by day. The gauges themselves can be coloured by agency, by record length or by how recently they last reported, with a legend, and a density heat map shows where the world is actually measured. "Select an area" drags a box and gives the gauges inside it as CSV. Every layer carries its attribution and licence in the rail, in the map credits and in an info panel; nothing needs a key, and the whole state (basemap, overlays, opacity, date, terrain, globe, colouring) is in the URL. Google Maps and Earth tiles are deliberately absent (their terms forbid this use), as is Esri's legacy imagery (it answers without a token, but Esri's docs require one).
- **The Explorer becomes an app**: a three-pane shell (sources and overlays on the left, the map, a tabbed inspector on the right) with the Analyst in a drawer beside the inspector instead of replacing it, so the gauge you are reading stays on screen while it works, and the question carries what you are looking at (station or point, map view, hidden sources) as a visible context line you can switch off. The station page is now Overview · Floods · Flows · Model · Catchment · Similar · Methods rather than one long scroll, and a tab that cannot be filled says why ("GR4J needs four or more years of daily discharge in m³/s") instead of quietly disappearing. Every card reports loading, "not available here" or "failed, retry" in place of a silent `console.info`, the Pyodide download has a progress bar wherever you are in the page, and GR4J, the bootstrap CI and Ask can be stopped. **The URL is the state**: selection, active tab, map view, source filter and the basins overlay all live in the hash, Back and Forward work, and "Copy link" gives the canonical Space URL rather than the iframe it happens to run in. Search is accent-folded, ranked and keyboard-navigable ("rhone" finds "Le Rhône à Anthon"), and a hit whose source is filtered out un-hides it instead of doing nothing. Every figure keeps its PNG button, every table has a CSV button, GR4J exports its simulation, and a **Cite** button finally shows the BibTeX and the concept DOI next to the methods used on the page. On a phone the sources and overlays slide over the map instead of vanishing, and the panel takes the rest. `explorer/app.js` is split into ES modules under `explorer/src/` (still no bundler, still a static site) and `explorer/build.py` copies the tree. (#231)
- Crop coefficients for **sorghum**, **groundnut** and **sugar beet** in `aquascope.agri.crop_water`: single-crop `KC_TABLE`, basal `KCB_TABLE` and `DEFAULT_STAGE_LENGTHS` entries, taken from FAO-56 Tables 12 and 17.

### Changed
- USGS gage height observations (`00065`) now normalise to `WaterLevelReading` in metres with `unit="m"` rather than falling through to generic `WaterQualitySample` in feet, preserving significant figures and aligning with all other hydrometric collectors. (#240)
- **One surface on the right, and a lot less to read** (#285). The Analyst opened *beside* the inspector so the station stayed on screen, but two cards of the same width and weight, side by side, do not read as an order to read them in: they read as clutter, and together they covered 60 % of a 1,440 px window, which is the crowding the map-first shell was meant to end. The Analyst takes the inspector's place now and names what it came from in its header, so the station is a line of text and one click away. The panel underneath keeps its scroll and its results. Picking something new on the map closes the Analyst rather than hiding what you just clicked.
  The reading was cut with it. The Ask panel was 230 words and 34 controls in a 374 px column: a 49-word opening paragraph, three tiers each carrying its own explanation, a two-line heading, eight two-line example chips and a 22-word footer. It is a segmented control with one note for the tier you actually picked, eight one-line examples, and no opening paragraph. The welcome card went from 237 words to 34 before its disclosure. The five peer buttons over the station tabs are one button and an overflow menu, and the record tile reads "1986–2026" instead of wrapping two full dates onto a second line.
- The public Streamlit deployments are retired: the stlite Space is now a redirect to the Explorer (it had been serving a v0.8.1 wheel), and the Docker Space files are removed (Hugging Face has not hosted them on a free account since 2026). `aquascope dashboard` stays in the package for local use and now runs the same `aquascope.workbench` code as everything else. (#235)
- **One LLM provider registry** (`aquascope/ai_engine/providers.py`): the analyst, the dashboard recommender and the Explorer read the same list instead of keeping three copies that drifted (which is why one retired Groq model broke all of them at once). The page gets it as `explorer/providers.json`, regenerated by `python -m aquascope.ai_engine.providers` and checked by a test; each provider now also carries its free-tier note and signup link, shown under the picker.
- `CITATION.cff` lists the v0.12.0 version DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21995649` (concept DOI unchanged).

### Fixed
- USGS: one canonical `US_STATE_CODES` mapping replaces the `NWIS_STATE_CODES` / `STATE_FIPS` pair, so the alpha and numeric lists can no longer drift. The keyless NWIS site sweep now sends American Samoa's FIPS 5-1 code `AQ` instead of `as` (which 400s, losing names for 19 sites on every run), and FM, MH and PW are covered as 64, 68 and 70. (#239)
- **BOM station lookup surfaces failures instead of returning a silently partial catalog** (#289). `BOMCollector.stations()` issues one request per BOM parameter type. When all requests fail, it now raises a `RuntimeError` rather than returning `[]`, allowing `harvest_stations` to record the source outage in `StationCatalog.error`. When a subset of parameter types fails, it logs a summary warning naming the lost parameter types and returns the partial catalog.
- CI: the Pyodide smoke workflow now triggers on changes to itself. Its `paths:` filter listed `pyodide_smoke.mjs` but not `pyodide-smoke.yml`, so an edit to the workflow alone could land without the smoke test ever running on it.
- USGS collector: support ISO 8601 timestamps ending with `Z` on Python 3.10 where `datetime.fromisoformat` rejects trailing `Z`, preventing silent drops of OGC records during normalisation.
- **"On device" looked broken and was not** (#287). It answers in about thirty seconds over a couple of tool calls, but for all of that time the panel said "Downloading the model: 100 %" and the button said "Working…". Nothing was downloading: Chrome fires `downloadprogress` with `loaded: 1` even when the built-in model is already on the machine, and the handler printed it verbatim, so a model that was thinking looked like a download wedged at the finish line. Only `availability()` decides whether anything is being fetched now, and the run reports what it is actually doing: "Thinking… (step 1 of 3)", "Running analyze_station…". The tier no longer claims "nothing to download" merely because the API exists.
- The Ask box kept the first station's question forever. It was only filled when empty, so after asking about one gauge you could open Ask on another and find "Summarise the record of L'Yvette à Villebon-sur-Yvette" still in the box, with the context line underneath naming the gauge you were actually looking at. Our own text is replaced when the selection changes; a question you typed is not. (#287)
- The Ask panel printed the whole generated context as prose under the checkbox: five lines naming the station, the map centre, the zoom and every active layer. That is what gets sent, not something to read, so it is behind "see what it sends" and the checkbox stays as the control. The example chips under the question box went from six to four. (#287)
- A gauge's agency is a shape as well as a colour on the map (#283). The six agency colours were never validated, and they fail an all-pairs colour-vision check in both themes: Hub'Eau's red and the Environment Agency's green are ΔE 4.2 apart under deuteranopia (Machado-Oliveira-Fernandes at severity 1.0), and those are the two largest European sources, so to a red-green colourblind reader most of western Europe was one undifferentiated wash. Six hues cannot be made to pass all-pairs however they are chosen, so identity gains a second channel rather than a new palette: circle for USGS, triangle for the Environment Agency, square for Hub'Eau, diamond for PEGELONLINE, pentagon for OPW, cross for CWA, drawn as SDF icons so "colour by record length" still repaints them and the shape goes on saying the agency underneath. The rail legend, the search results, the nearest-gauge list and the Analyst's station chips show the same shapes, because a legend that showed only colour would be describing half of what the map draws. The colours themselves are unchanged.
- The Explorer's scale bar read "NaN m" with the inspector and the Analyst both open. The map tells MapLibre how much of it the floating cards cover so the camera centres on what you can see, and at 1,440 px that figure is 859 px; past about 52 % of the width the centre is far enough off that the scale control cannot unproject on a globe. The cover figure is capped a little under half now. (#281)
- **Ask opens on what you can do without a key** (#271). The drawer led with "Your key" preselected and the credentials form expanded, so the first thing a visitor met was the one thing they could not do, and the eight recorded examples that need no key sat roughly 700 px below it. The tiers are now Worked examples (the default), On your device and Your own key; the examples lead, the key form is collapsed unless a key is already stored, and a returning reader with a stored key still lands on their own tier. Clicking a worked example also brings its answer into view and moves focus there, instead of writing it far enough down the drawer that the click looked like it had failed.
- The Explorer's charts read the page's own tokens instead of Plotly's defaults, which were `#444` text on near-white gridlines: on a dark card that is grey-on-grey text under glaring white rules. Axis text, gridlines, the legend and the hover label now come from the stylesheet, and a figure drawn before the reader switched theme redraws itself. Two marks also stopped competing with the agency colour they sit beside. The annual maxima on a hydrograph mark the same series, so they are ink with a ring punched out of the card rather than a second hue; red markers on the UK's green line were ΔE 5.5 apart under protanopia, below the floor. GR4J's simulated line separates from the observed record by lightness and a dashed stroke for the same reason: on a French gauge the old red simulated line and the red observed line were ΔE 7.1 apart with *normal* colour vision. Where a series colour would fall under 3:1 on the dark card (OPW's purple is 1.96:1), it is lifted towards the page ink rather than kept as a second palette that could drift from the map's. (#281)
- The Explorer gave up on a map that was working. `initMap` waited twenty seconds for MapLibre's `load` event and then declared the map dead, and everything that needs a map (the gauge layers, the projection, the framing, the layer rail) was gated on that verdict, so a slow first paint left a fully rendered basemap with no gauges on it under a notice saying it had failed, recoverable only by reloading. It reproduces every time the page is opened in a background tab, because a hidden tab renders no frames and so never fires `load` at all. The twenty seconds now only decide when to say "this is taking a while": if the map does load, late or not, it is brought online exactly as a fast one would be, warning cleared. (#281)
- The Explorer's `hidden` attribute was not hiding things. Several class rules set `display`, which outranks the user agent's `[hidden] { display: none }`, so the map's WebGL fallback (an opaque panel) sat over the map the whole time, and the overlay date picker, the colour legend, the area-selection result and the empty tab badges all painted while the code believed they were hidden. `[hidden]` is now authoritative. (#281)
- A `#p=<lat>,<lon>` link, the "climate of Taipei" example and picking a place from the search box dropped a marker and left the camera where it was, so the point was usually off screen. `search.js` had been passing `fly: true` since #231 to a `selectPoint` that had no such option. Points fly like gauges now. (#281, #231)
- BasinATLAS drew every level-6 basin on Earth from zoom 1, which buried the world view under outlines the moment a catchment lookup switched the layer on; it starts at zoom 3 now. The upstream sub-basin fill also outlined each of its several hundred polygons at full strength, which added up to a solid purple mesh over the catchment rather than a wash. (#281)
- Opening the Explorer's layer rail left focus on the button that opened it, so Escape (which an untrapped surface only owns from inside) could not close it. The rail was transitioning `visibility`, so it was still computed as hidden on the frame the focus call ran. (#281)
- CI: the contributors-board check read the CLI's "Unknown contributors" section as missing names. An open-ended `sed` range ran past the "Missing contributors" section to the end of the output, so a login that GitHub's contributors API has not caught up on yet (it lags for hours after a first PR merges) failed the job with that section's header as the error text. The range now keeps only the indented lines that belong to the missing section.
- GRDC: unfiltered fetches no longer pull the whole archive. `fetch_raw(max_items=...)` truncates both the in-situ (Zenodo) and satellite (RSEG) paths with a log line, matching the other collectors. (#173)
- Dashboard: pressing Collect with a required field empty surfaced the collector's raw `ValueError` (PEGELONLINE station UUID, BOM station number, NOAA-NWPS LID or bounding box). The Collect page now names the missing field before calling the collector. (#174)
- A second pass over the Analyst's checks, after reading all eight recorded answers. Four more ways a correct answer was marked down: a station named only in the search result that found it counted as unnamed, because the analysis payload carries the id and no name; `mm yr-1` and `km2` were read as claims of -1 and 2; a coordinate the question gave and the tool accepted was called invented; and "no significant trend in low flow" was called a contradiction of a test that ran on annual means. Identifiers are now found at any depth, unit exponents are not numbers, a tool's arguments count as grounding, conventional thresholds like 0.05 are not measurements, and a significance claim is only weighed against the series the test actually ran on. The coordinate handling is stricter than before, not looser: "68.6 W" is checked as -68.6, so a hemisphere error is caught where previously nothing was. (#233, #234)
- A question was lost whenever the model's own tool call would not parse as JSON. Groq rejects the whole request with `400 tool_use_failed` when that happens, and it happened twice running on one showcase question: the model wrote raw Python where the JSON arguments object belongs. The model wrote it, so it is asked to write it again, with a short note saying the arguments must be one JSON object and how to escape code inside it. Two attempts, then the failure surfaces: a model that cannot format a call will not learn on the third. (#233, #234)
- The context budget from the previous fix under-read its own requests: it measured the text of each message and ignored the `tool_calls` the model writes, which for a `run_python` call is a whole snippet, so a conversation budgeted at 6,000 tokens arrived as 9,300 and was refused. The whole message payload is measured now. And rather than guess a window we cannot see, a `413` is treated as the provider saying so: the budget halves and the request goes again, down to a floor where a 413 must mean something else. (#233, #234)
- Half the showcase questions failed with `413 Request too large ... Limit 8000, Requested 12073`. Not a rate limit, so retrying could never help: the accumulated tool results were larger than the whole per-minute window. A per-result cap of 14,000 characters is no use when three results together exceed the budget, so the loop now fits the whole conversation to `MAX_CONTEXT_CHARS` before each request, trimming the oldest tool results first and leaving the newest, the question and the system prompt untouched. Each trim says how much it removed. (#233, #234)
- The Analyst's checks failed on correct answers, which is worse than having no checks, because the unmet ones are printed to the reader as "what this answer does not establish". The first live recording scored 2 of 5 on an answer that was right in every particular. The cause was typography: a good model writes `m³ s⁻¹`, a non-breaking hyphen inside a station id, and `14 555` grouped with a narrow space, and the checks compared all of it against plain ASCII. The answer is now folded (NFKC, dashes to ASCII, grouped digits joined) before anything is compared, a unit is recognised however it is spelled and is no longer read as a claim of its own digits, and dates and derived percentages are not treated as numbers needing a source. A fabricated number, a missing interval, a mismatched significance claim, a missing unit and an unnamed record are all still caught, each with a test. (#233, #234)
- The showcase job installed `.[dev]`, but `describe_catchment` and `regionalize_signatures` read BasinATLAS through pyogrio, so two questions answered over a failed tool. It installs `.[dev,basins]` now, and an entry whose tools all failed is no longer published: a model will answer regardless, and an answer with nothing behind it is the last thing to show as a worked example. (#233)
- `showcase.yml` broke three times around the same seam, and the workflow tests now cover it properly. A pull-request body written inline in a `run: |` block put its paragraphs at column 0, which ends the block scalar, and GitHub answered 422 on dispatch; PyYAML had not caught it, because a paragraph containing a colon parses as a valid top-level key. Rewriting it as a heredoc then failed on the runner, because YAML strips the block indent and the terminator, sitting inside an `else`, arrived indented, so bash reported "here-document delimited by end-of-file". The body is built with `printf` now, which has no column requirements at all. Three guards: every workflow parses, its top-level keys are only the eight GitHub defines, and every `run:` script passes `bash -n` with GitHub's `${{ }}` expressions stubbed out. Each was checked against the broken form before being kept. (#233)
- A free tier's per-minute limit ended a run instead of pausing it. The LLM transport now retries 429 and 5xx, waiting exactly as long as the provider asked ("Please try again in 14.5725s"), backing off 1, 2, 4, 8 seconds when it says nothing, capped at 30 and bounded at four retries; 401 and 4xx are not retried, because they will not improve with time. The showcase recorder also pauses between questions (`--pause`, 25 s by default). The first live recording got 1 of 8: one tool-calling question spends most of a minute's token budget on Groq's free tier, and nothing waited for the window to refill. (#233)
- `showcase.yml` pushed its recordings straight to `main`, which branch protection rejects. It opens a pull request on `showcase/recordings` instead, labelled `no-changelog`. That is also the better shape: the recorded prose is written by a model and published under the project's name, so it should be read before it goes live. (#233)
- `aquascope.showcase.diagnose` reported a rejected key (401) as a permissions problem and pointed at Hugging Face's Inference Providers setting, which is the fix for 403 and sends you looking in the wrong place. The two are separate now: 401 says the value itself is wrong, names the shape of a Groq key and shows how to pipe it in so a prompt cannot truncate it. (#233)
- Clicking **Ask** in the first moments after the Explorer loaded did nothing at all, and said nothing about why: `initAsk()` opened with `await loadProviders()` (a fetch of `providers.json`) and only attached the button's click listener afterwards, so the app's headline control was inert until that response came back. Everything that does not need the provider list is now wired before the first await, the list fills in last, and running before it arrives says so instead of throwing on an undefined provider. (#231)
- The docs site never showed the Explorer's documentation page: `docs.yml` copied the app itself into `site/explorer/`, on top of the `explorer.md` that mkdocs had just rendered there, so the nav entry "The Explorer (click any gauge)" opened the app and the page was unreachable. The copy now lives under `/explorer/app/`. (#231)
- `python -m aquascope.showcase` reported nothing but "recorded 0/8" and a wall of identical tracebacks when the key it found was not allowed to call a model (a Hugging Face write token scoped to repositories cannot call Inference Providers). It now says which of those it is and what to set instead, and the workflow warns when HF_TOKEN is the only key available. (#233)
- `.github/workflows/showcase.yml` was not valid YAML: the multi-line git commit message sat at column 0, which ends the `run: |` block scalar and takes the rest of the file with it. GitHub does not fail loudly on this, it simply registers no triggers, so the weekly recording never fired and `workflow run showcase.yml` answered "this workflow has no workflow_dispatch trigger". The message is now two `-m` flags, and a new test parses every workflow file and asserts each one still declares triggers and jobs. (#233)
- The Explorer's worker fetched the aquascope wheel by a URL whose filename does not change between deploys, so a returning browser could run a cached, older wheel against a newer page (which is how a missing module first showed up). The worker now fetches the wheel with `cache: "reload"` and installs it from Pyodide's filesystem.
- `aquascope.models` no longer imports the scikit-learn ensembles at package import time (PEP 562 lazy attributes), so `from aquascope.models.rainfall_runoff import GR4J`, `aquascope.gym` and `pip install "aquascope[gym]"` work on a bare install; the ensembles still import on first use with the `ml` extra.
- Groq retired `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` and `llama-3.1-8b-instant` on 2026-08-16, so `aquascope ask --provider groq`, the Explorer's Ask panel and the dashboard recommender failed with a model-not-found error on the default. The Groq defaults are now `openai/gpt-oss-120b` (analyst, Explorer) and `openai/gpt-oss-120b` / `openai/gpt-oss-20b` (recommender picker); an explicit `--model` still wins.
- Explorer: the "Monthly climate" chart on the click-anywhere card drew eight bars instead of twelve. Plotly merges categorical x values with the same label, and the one-letter month labels repeated (M, J, A), so May, June, July and August were folded into March, January and April. Months are now labelled Jan..Dec.
- USGS keyed path: `stateCd` / `countyCd` are translated to the ANSI codes the OGC API expects (`MD` to `24`, `24033` to `033` with the implied state `24` if `state_code` is not in the parameter list). Comma-separated `stateCd` / `countyCd` / `huc` values trigger a warning since the OGC API takes single values for these fields - we choose to pass the first value of the comma-separated list as the parameter in these instances rather than returning nothing. (#160)
- Explorer: `fmt(x, digits)` ignored `digits` below 10, so catchment areas and populations printed three decimals ("303.412 km²"); the trend sentence read "a increasing trend"; and a slow network was reported as "WebGL is off" (WebGL is now tested directly, and a slow style load says so). (#231)
- CI: Dynamically resolve the Pyodide runtime version from explorer/config.js for the WASM smoke test workflow and cache keys, and update smoke verification to test aquascope.explore import and pyodide_http.patch_all() instead of dashboard app imports. (#268)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-18

The "on top of the archive" release. With the world's public gauges, their
observations and their BasinATLAS catchments in one place, aquascope now does
what a library alone could not: it says what flow to expect where there is no
gauge (and how much to trust that), finds the gauged basins that look like
yours, exports Caravan-format datasets, calibrates a rainfall-runoff model in
the browser in seconds, evaluates hydrologic agents on real basins, repairs
its own collectors, and reads from R, QGIS and DuckDB without any of it
installed. Same day as 0.11.0 on purpose: 0.11.0 was the platform, 0.12.0 is
the first things built on it.

### Added
- **GR4J in the Explorer, and a 9x faster GR4J** (`explorer/gr4j.js`, "Rainfall-runoff model" card): discharge stations with a catchment area get a "Calibrate GR4J" button; the page fetches Open-Meteo precipitation and FAO-56 ET0 at the gauge, converts the record to mm/d over the station's area, calibrates X1..X4 by differential evolution (KGE, first 65 % of the record after a one-year warm-up) in the browser in about two seconds for 40 years, and shows the parameters, KGE/NSE/log-NSE/PBIAS on calibration and validation, and observed vs simulated flow. The JS model is checked against the Python one to round-off (`tests/test_models/test_gr4j_js.py`, runs when node is present). `GR4J.simulate` in Python now uses a plain-float production loop, one convolution per unit hydrograph and a plain-float routing loop instead of two `np.roll` per day: same numbers to 1e-14, about nine times faster (12 years: 30 ms -> 3 ms), which is what makes calibration and HydroGym episodes quick. (#189 Phase 3, first item)
- **HydroGym Phase 0** (`aquascope.gym`, `pip install aquascope[gym]`, `aquascope gym basins|run|leaderboard`, `docs/gym.md`, `notebooks/08_hydrogym_phase0.ipynb`): a gym-style evaluation environment for hydrologic agents. `CalibrationEnv` wraps GR4J calibration on one basin as an episode (action = X1..X4 or the unit cube, reward = NSE / KGE / log-NSE on the calibration period after warm-up, NSE/KGE/log-NSE/PBIAS on calibration and validation in `info`, a 16-number observation plus the raw daily frame), passes gymnasium's `check_env` and works without gymnasium; `synthetic_basin` (GR4J truth + noise, offline) and `load_basin` (any Archive station with a catchment area: discharge bundle in mm/d over the agency or BasinATLAS area, Open-Meteo precipitation and FAO-56 ET0 at the gauge, cached), `suggest_basins` from the signatures table (long, perennial, low-snow records); baselines `random_search`, `nelder_mead` (env-only) and `differential_evolution` (free simulator, each generation one step) with `run_leaderboard`. (#175, Phase 0)
- **Estimated flow regime for ungauged points** (`aquascope.archive.regionalize`, `aquascope basins regionalize LAT LON`, MCP + analyst tool `regionalize_signatures`, Explorer "Estimated flow regime" table): the weekly harvest now computes the flow signatures of every gauged station with 10+ years of archived discharge and a catchment area (`basins/station_signatures.parquet`: mean, median, Q95, Q05 and mean annual maximum daily flow in mm/d, runoff ratio, baseflow index, FDC slope, high/low-flow frequency, zero-flow fraction, seasonality, flashiness) and predicts every donor from the others (`basins/regionalization_skill.json`: NSE, R2, median absolute relative error per signature and method, leave-one-out). Any point then gets each signature transferred from the k most similar donors (inverse-distance weights, geometric mean for magnitudes, band = one weighted standard deviation) or by ridge regression on the standardised catchment attributes over all donors, with the leave-one-out skill next to every number. `aquascope basins signatures` and `aquascope basins loo` are the workflow steps. Bloeschl et al. 2013, Oudin et al. 2008, Addor et al. 2018. Closes the predictive half of #53.
- **Catchment areas in the station catalog**: USGS (`drainage_area` from monitoring-locations), UK EA (`catchmentArea`) and Hub'Eau (`surface_bv`, one referentiel/sites join) `stations()` now carry `extra.catchment_area_km2`. `basins/station_catchments.parquet` gains `area_km2` / `area_source` (agency area, else BasinATLAS `up_area`) and `attribute_scope`: a gauge that drains only a corner of its level-12 sub-basin (agency area under half the sub-basin's upstream area) is described by the sub-basin's own attributes rather than the big river's; the similar-basins search uses `area_km2` and a station's own row as the target; the Caravan exporter reads the catalog area before calling the agency. `harvest.yml` gets a `skip_obs` input for catalog-only reruns.
- **Readers without aquascope** (`docs/readers.md`, `integrations/qgis/aquascope_gauges.qlr`): how to use the Archive from R (arrow, sf), DuckDB, QGIS (GeoParquet, FlatGeobuf and PMTiles over HTTP; a drag-and-drop layer definition styled by source with agency links) and Julia.
- **Self-healing harvest** (`aquascope.maintenance.repair`, `.github/scripts/harvest_repair.py`, `.github/workflows/repair.yml`): after each scheduled harvest, failing sources with a possible code cause (404, changed format, unclassified) get an automated repair attempt: evidence (collector source and tests, registry entry, recent commits, live probes of the URLs it uses), one model call that must answer `no_fix` or a minimal unified diff limited to the collector and its tests, then `git apply --check`, `ruff`, the collector's tests and a live smoke call; a verified patch becomes a `repair/<source>-<date>` branch and a pull request labelled `collector-health` + `automated-repair` (never merged automatically), anything else a comment on the health issue with the reasoning and the rejected diff. Runs only when an LLM key secret is set. (direction review, "self-healing collectors")
- **Similar gauged basins** (`aquascope.archive.similar`, `aquascope basins similar LAT LON | --station SOURCE/ID`, MCP `similar_basins`, Explorer): the weekly harvest joins every catalog station to its BasinATLAS sub-basin and publishes `basins/station_catchments.parquet`; on it, any point or station gets the gauged basins whose catchments resemble it most (weighted distance in standardised BasinATLAS attribute space, great-circle distance, or both), with per-feature deltas and the citation (Bloeschl et al. 2013, Oudin et al. 2008). The donor-selection half of prediction in ungauged basins (#53); the analyst is told to use it before analysing donors. `load_stations(path=...)` reads a local `stations.parquet`.
- **Caravan-format export from the Archive** (`aquascope caravan export|validate`, `aquascope.archive.caravan`): per-gauge daily forcing (Open-Meteo's ERA5-Land + ERA5 blend at the gauge point) and area-normalised streamflow in mm/d from the discharge bundles, Caravan's climate indices (a port of `caravan_utils.calculate_climate_indices`, FAO-PM variants), HydroATLAS-style attributes from BasinATLAS, `attributes_other` with area and provenance, licences and a `provenance.json`; USGS, UK EA and Hub'Eau, areas from the agency (`drainage_area`, `catchmentArea`, `surface_bv`) else BasinATLAS. The Open-Meteo collector accepts `models=` for the `/archive` endpoint. (#100)

### Changed
- README, docs and `CITATION.cff` carry the Zenodo concept DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21903143` (v0.11.0: `10.5281/zenodo.21989509`).

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-18

The platform release. aquascope grows from a Python library into an open
archive of the world's public gauges, a zero-install Explorer on top of it,
and an analyst that answers questions from it with citations. Everything runs
on free tiers (GitHub Actions, Hugging Face datasets and static Spaces,
Open-Meteo, the agencies' own APIs).

### Added

**The Archive** (`aquascope.archive`, `aquascope harvest`, weekly
`harvest.yml`, dataset [`Rekin226/aquascope-gauges`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rekin226/aquascope-gauges)) (#188)

- Station catalogs: `BaseCollector.stations()`, `aquascope.find_stations()` and `aquascope stations --bbox w,s,e,n --variable discharge --format geojson|csv|json` for USGS, UK EA, Hub'Eau, PEGELONLINE, Ireland OPW and Taiwan CWA. The harvest publishes `stations.parquet` (GeoParquet 1.0), `stations.geojson`, `health.json` and a regenerated dataset card; 45,919 stations on the first run. (#187)
- Daily observations, budgeted and incremental: `obs/<variable>/<source>/<station_id>.csv.gz` for USGS discharge and gage height (feet converted to metres), UK EA flow, level, rainfall and borehole groundwater levels (mAOD), Hub'Eau daily mean discharge (`obs_elab`) and Taiwan CWA rainfall, only for sources whose registry entry says `redistributable=True`. `obs/manifest.json` (version 2, keyed `source/variable`) carries the cursor; a station is refreshed after 30 days; failures never sink a run.
- Parquet bundles: `aquascope harvest bundles` rolls each folder into `obs/<variable>/<source>.parquet` (`station_id, date, value`, joinable to `stations.parquet`); `aquascope.archive.load_observations(source, variable)` reads one from the Hub.
- Catchments: the level-12 sub-basins of BasinATLAS (HydroATLAS v1.0, CC BY 4.0) published under `basins/` (indexed FlatGeobuf for point lookups, topology and attribute parquet, PMTiles) by `basins.yml`; `aquascope basins at LAT LON | upstream | build`; `describe_catchment(lat, lon)` gives the sub-basin, the upstream area and the catchment's climate, land cover, soils, population and regulation, reading only the needed parquet row groups over HTTP. New `basins` extra (pyogrio, geopandas, shapely). HydroBASINS itself was ruled out on licence grounds. (#189, #100)
- Harvest self-reporting (`.github/scripts/harvest_issues.py`): one `collector-health` issue per failing source with a deterministic diagnosis (404 / 429 / TLS / timeout / 5xx / format), commented while it keeps failing, closed when the source recovers.
- `aquascope.explore.fetch_series` reads a station's archive file first and falls back to the agency, so the Explorer and the MCP tools stop re-hitting agencies for mirrored stations.

**The Explorer** (`explorer/`, live at https://rekin226-aquascope-explorer.static.hf.space/ and under `/explorer/` on the docs site) (#189)

- A static page with no server: a MapLibre map of every station in the Archive (DuckDB-WASM reads the GeoParquet in place, GeoJSON fallback), search, permalinks. Click a station and the observed record is fetched through aquascope's own collectors in a Pyodide worker: hydrograph, annual maxima, GEV (L-moments) and Log-Pearson III return levels with 90 % confidence limits, an on-demand bootstrap GEV band, the flow-duration curve, a Mann-Kendall trend, a CSV download and a methods-and-citations panel.
- Click anywhere that is not a gauge (`aquascope.explore.anywhere`, `#p=<lat>,<lon>`): ERA5 rainfall and temperature, FAO-56 ET0 and aridity class, GloFAS modelled discharge with an indicative return-period table, and the nearest gauges, from Open-Meteo, keyless.
- Catchments: NLDI drainage basins drawn for every USGS gauge and any US point (public domain, nothing stored); BasinATLAS everywhere else on land, with the sub-basin found in the browser (FlatGeobuf range reads), the upstream sub-basins walked in DuckDB-WASM and highlighted on the map, and an attribute card ("Basins" toggle in the legend).
- Ask ✨: `aquascope.ai_engine.analyst.ask` runs inside the browser worker; bring your own key (Groq, Hugging Face, OpenAI, Mistral, OpenRouter or a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint) and it goes from the tab straight to the provider. Tool calls stream into a log, the report renders with its Data and Methods sections, stations touched become chips that open on the map.
- `aquascope.explore` (`analyze_station`, `fetch_series`, `analyze_series`, `flood_ci`, `to_csv`, `anywhere`) is the shared `(source, station_id) -> answer` entry point behind the Explorer, the CLI and the MCP server. Deployed by `explorer.yml`.

**The Analyst and the MCP server**

- MCP server (`aquascope mcp`, `aquascope.mcp_server`, new `mcp` extra) for Claude Desktop / Claude Code / Cursor: `list_sources`, `find_stations` (the published catalog, no agency call, nearest-first or bbox), `get_timeseries`, `analyze_station`, `flood_frequency`, `describe_catchment`, `describe_methods`, `archive_health`, plus two resources; response sizes are bounded by design; works with the Python SDK 1.x and 2.x. (#113)
- `aquascope ask` (`aquascope.ai_engine.analyst`): a tool loop over the same functions for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint with tool calling; the Markdown report ends with **Data** and **Methods and citations** sections assembled from tool results, never from the model. `aquascope.ai_engine.llm_transport.UrllibChatClient`, a dependency-free client that also runs under pyodide-http, is used when the `openai` package is missing, so `ask` needs no extra.
- `aquascope ingest` (`aquascope.ingest`): any CSV/TSV/Excel/JSON export, a heuristic (or LLM-proposed, heuristic-validated) column mapping, a deterministic apply (sentinels dropped before unit conversion, duplicates, timezone), a QA report (coverage, gaps, spikes, negatives, per-year coverage), a clean `date,value` CSV in SI units plus `.qa.json` / `.qa.md`, and `analyze_series` on the result.
- Dashboard: deployment-supplied free AI (`hosted_llm_config()` reads `HF_TOKEN` or `AQUASCOPE_LLM_API_KEY` + `_BASE_URL` / `_MODEL` from the environment or `st.secrets`) offered as the default provider when present; `RecommendationResult` and `recommend_with_llm_detailed()` report which engine answered (`llm` / `rule_based`), the provider and model, and a readable error when the LLM was asked for but not used; a troubleshooting section for the recommender.

**Collectors and the registry**

- Shared source registry with coverage and terms (`aquascope/registry.py`): every collector described once with `agency`, `country`, `variables` (the `aquascope.schemas.station.VARIABLES` vocabulary), `supports_bbox`, `supports_station_lookup`, `output_model`, `license`, `redistributable` and `attribution`; the CLI, the dashboard Collect page, `aquascope.collect()` and the two Taiwan WRA groundwater collectors read from it; `tests/test_registry.py` guards drift. Registry extraction by @laishettikarthik-tech (#163), extension per #187.
- BOM (Australia) collector (`collectors/bom.py`): streamflow, water level, storage and groundwater level from the Bureau of Meteorology's Water Data Online (KiWIS), about 8,000 stations, no key. Thanks @adjenk (#181, closes #4)
- Taiwan CWA climate collector (`collectors/taiwan_cwa.py`): daily rainfall, temperature, humidity, radiation, wind and pan evaporation from the keyless CODIS archive, history back to 1960, in the new `ClimateReading` schema; the observed-forcing layer for CAMELS-TW. (#177, contributes to #100)
- Hub'Eau elaborated series (`fetch_raw(elaborated="QmnJ")`): the `/obs_elab` endpoint (multi-decade daily and monthly means and extremes) normalises into `StreamflowReading` / `WaterLevelReading`, so French stations get flood frequency.
- USGS: station names without a key (NWIS site service fallback when the OGC walk is throttled); the per-record catchment-area lookup is memoized.
- `relax_strict_tls` on `CachedHTTPClient` for Taiwan government certificate chains that Python 3.13+ rejects by default, keeping full chain and hostname verification (#169). Flow-duration-curve slope signature `aquascope.hydrology.fdc_slope` and `SignatureReport.fdc_slope` (#45). CI CHANGELOG enforcement with a `no-changelog` opt-out label (#144).

### Fixed

- USGS OGC pagination could spin forever: `next` links were re-fetched with `params={}`, which made httpx drop the cursor, so page one came back from the disk cache in a silent loop; next links are now fetched as-is and a repeated cursor stops the walk.
- USGS keyed path filters: with an API key, `station_id` / `parameter` / `stateCd` / `countyCd` / `huc` now map onto the OGC daily collection's filter parameters instead of being ignored (a per-station fetch used to crawl the national collection). (closes #160)
- USGS discharge normalises into `StreamflowReading` (ft³/s to m³/s, miles² to km², significant figures kept, catchment area fetched when missing). (#155, contributes to #97 and #104)
- USGS CLI `--days` and kwarg handling, with tests for parameter acceptance and API-key selection. (#159)
- Hub'Eau: water level and discharge normalise into `WaterLevelReading` and `StreamflowReading` (L/s to m³/s without a rounding error, catchment area from one batched `referentiel/sites` lookup); station-filtered fetches send `code_entite`, the only station parameter Hub'Eau v2 accepts (`code_station` was silently ignored and returned the whole network); pagination no longer strips the filters off the `next` link. (#164, closes #97 and #104)
- The AI recommender no longer degrades silently: a missing `openai` package, a bad key, a dead endpoint or an unparseable reply used to look like a successful call; the dashboard and CLI now say which engine produced the list and why. The Hugging Face provider pointed at a retired host (now `router.huggingface.co/v1`); the LLM output contract asked for an array while forcing an object (now `{"recommendations": [...]}` with tolerant parsing); every shipped Hugging Face model and Groq's `mixtral-8x7b-32768` were unserved and are replaced with models verified against the live catalogues.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-12

A correctness release first and a feature release second.

Two sign errors in the GEV L-moment estimator had been shipping since v0.4.0,
quietly returning flood quantiles off by up to a factor of two. They are fixed,
and the Potomac worked example that had been publishing a 500-year estimate 54%
below the FEMA reference is regenerated and now validated against that reference
on both estimators. If you have used `flood_analysis(method="gev_lmoments")` or
`regional_frequency_analysis`, please recheck your numbers.

Alongside that: Brazil and the UK join the collector list, bringing it to 27,
every registered collector is now reachable from the dashboard with a CI guard
to keep it that way, groundwater analysis gets its own dashboard page, and the
CLI gained shell completion.

Most of this release came from the community again. Thanks to @taran-dev4u,
@JamesBoardman27, @laishettikarthik-tech, and @adjenk.

### Added
- **Shell completion** (`aquascope completion bash|zsh|fish`): emits an argcomplete script for the chosen shell, bringing the CLI to 20 commands. Thanks @adjenk (#157, closes #28).
- **Every collector reachable from the dashboard** (`dashboard/views/collect.py`): the Collect page went from 21 sources to all 27, adding NOAA NWPS, Ireland OPW, PEGELONLINE, CAMELS-CL, UK EA, and CAMELS-BR with per-source parameter forms and region entries. Home-page counts now derive from `len(SOURCES)` instead of a hardcoded number, and a drift guard (`tests/test_cli/test_dashboard_sources.py`) fails CI if a registered collector is missing from the page, so a new source cannot merge without wiring the UI. Thanks @taran-dev4u (#145, closes #143).
- **UK Environment Agency collector** (`collectors/uk_ea.py`): real-time river level, flow, rainfall, and groundwater telemetry from the EA Hydrology API, at 15-minute or daily resolution across the England station network. Emitted as `StreamflowReading` and `WaterLevelReading`, with station, WISKI ID, bounding-box and observed-property filters. No API key required. Thanks @JamesBoardman27 (#133).
- **Groundwater dashboard page** (`dashboard/views/groundwater.py`): SGI standardised groundwater index, drought event detection, recharge estimation, and aquifer tools as a workspace page. Thanks @laishettikarthik-tech (#139, closes #125).
- **CAMELS-BR collector** (`collectors/camels_br.py`): daily observed streamflow for Brazilian catchments from the CAMELS-BR large-sample dataset on Zenodo, joined with catchment attributes (gauge name, coordinates, area). Emitted as `StreamflowReading` with `catchment_area_km2` set, so `runoff_mm_day` comes for free. AquaScope's 27th source. Thanks @taran-dev4u (#140, closes #124).
- **Flow Duration Curve (FDC) slope signature** (`aquascope.hydrology.fdc_slope`): added log-space percentile slope signature function and `fdc_slope` field on `SignatureReport`. Thanks @taran-dev4u (#148, closes #45).

### Fixed
- **`flood_analysis(method="gev_lmoments")` returned incorrect return levels** in every release from v0.4.0 through v0.9.0. Two sign errors in the GEV L-moment estimator (the shape passed to scipy, and the location term) made fitted quantiles off by roughly 0.5x to 2x depending on the tail, always understating heavy-tailed floods. Parameter recovery is now within 0.5% of truth on large synthetic samples. `fit_gev` also seeds its ML fit from L-moments and constrains the shape to a plausible range, so 40-year records no longer produce absurd return levels (previously a shape of -6.2 and a 100-year flood of 3.3e11). **If you used `gev_lmoments`, recheck your results.** Thanks @taran-dev4u (#154, closes #119).
- **`regional_frequency_analysis` growth curve carried the same two sign errors**, so regional return levels were low and got worse at longer return periods (on a homogeneous synthetic region the 100-year growth factor was 41% below the analytical value). Corrected alongside the estimator above. A residual uniform bias remains under investigation in #156.
- **Potomac flood-frequency example corrected** (`docs/examples/potomac_flood_frequency.md`): the published GEV column came from the buggy estimator and read 54% below the FEMA reference at the 500-year level. Regenerated against the live USGS record, the GEV estimates now sit within 10% of the FEMA Flood Insurance Study at every return period. The sample size label and a stale `bootstrap_ci` argument in the reproduction snippet were fixed too.
- **Runoff ratio date index alignment** (`aquascope.hydrology.runoff_ratio`): extracted standalone `runoff_ratio` function that strictly aligns precipitation and discharge dates via inner index intersection prior to computing total volume ratios. Thanks @taran-dev4u (#148).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-04

Four new countries, a rebuilt dashboard, and a live in-browser demo. AquaScope
now reaches 25 data sources, and the Streamlit app went from a single-file
monolith to a multipage workspace that runs client-side in a browser with the
collectors still working.

Most of this release came from the community: seven external contributors wrote
all four new collectors and most of the new analysis and plotting features.
Thank you.

### Added
- **NOAA NWPS collector** (`collectors/noaa_nwps.py`): the US National Water
  Prediction Service, covering streamflow forecasts, stream observations, crest
  history, flood impacts, low-water history, flood-category levels, and gauge
  metadata. No API key required. Available as
  `aquascope collect --source noaa_nwps`. Thanks @AB1775 (#138).
- **Ireland OPW collector** (`collectors/ireland_opw.py`): real-time river and
  lake water level from waterlevel.ie at 15-minute resolution, across hundreds
  of Office of Public Works stations. Station geometry comes from the OPW
  GeoJSON index and series from the per-station CSV exports, with column names
  resolved defensively since the endpoint serves more than one CSV shape.
  Station refs outside the 1-41000 republication range are filtered out per
  OPW's terms. No API key required. Thanks @laishettikarthik-tech
  (#130, closes #123).
- **Germany PEGELONLINE collector** (`collectors/pegelonline.py`): recent water
  level and discharge observations from federal waterway gauges, emitted as
  `WaterLevelReading` and `StreamflowReading`. Supports station UUIDs, W/Q
  selection, CLI collection, and the upstream 31-day history limit. No API key
  required. Thanks @taran-dev4u (#131).
- **CAMELS-CL collector** (`collectors/camels_cl.py`): daily observed streamflow
  for 516 Chilean catchments from the CR2 large-sample dataset, joined with
  catchment attributes (area, coordinates). AquaScope's first South American
  source. Thanks @adjenk (#116).
- **Area-normalized streamflow** (`hydrology.streamflow`): `stage_to_runoff`
  chains a rating curve straight through to mm/day, and
  `discharge_cms_to_runoff_mm_day` converts a single discharge value given a
  catchment area. `StreamflowReading` gained `catchment_area_km2`, and both
  catchment area and runoff now route into the xarray export. Thanks
  @laishettikarthik-tech (#103, closes #98).
- **Double-mass plot** (`viz.diagnostics.double_mass_plot`): the classic
  cumulative-versus-cumulative consistency check for spotting station shifts or
  instrument changes in paired records. Thanks @aobaruwa (#107).
- **Optional Plotly backend for `plot_hydrograph`** (`viz/hydro.py`): pass
  `backend="plotly"` for an interactive figure instead of matplotlib. The
  default stays matplotlib, so existing code is unaffected. Thanks @adjenk
  (#134, closes #25).
- **Canonical SPI drought classification** (`climate.indices.drought_class`):
  McKee et al. category labels with explicit boundary and missing-value
  handling. Thanks @taran-dev4u (#132).
- **Dashboard 2.0** (`aquascope/dashboard/`): the Streamlit dashboard was rebuilt
  from a 2,100-line monolith into a multipage workspace app (`st.navigation`)
  with a shared dataset flowing through every page.
  - **Smart insights layer** (`_insights.py`): whatever dataset lands in the
    workspace is auto-profiled (datetime/discharge/parameter/coordinate columns
    detected), quality-scored, quietly screened against WHO guidelines, and
    answered with one-click "suggested next steps" that navigate to the right
    analysis page.
  - **21 collectors in the UI** (`views/collect.py`): the Collect page went from
    15 sources to 21, adding GRDC, Hub'Eau, India WRIS, Taiwan data.gov.tw, and
    Taiwan WRA IoT and FHY, with per-source parameter forms, a region filter,
    CSV/JSON upload, and two demo datasets. Nested `location` objects are
    flattened to `latitude`/`longitude` so maps work out of the box. The four
    sources added later in this release (NOAA NWPS, Ireland OPW, PEGELONLINE,
    CAMELS-CL) are reachable from the Python API and the CLI but are not wired
    into the Collect page yet.
  - **Interactive Plotly charts everywhere** (`_charts.py`): time series, box
    plots, correlation heatmaps, histograms, FDCs (with direct Q50/Q95 labels),
    hydrographs with baseflow fill, SPI timelines, return-level curves with
    bootstrap CI bands, WHO exceedance bars, MapLibre station maps, and the
    FAO-56 demand/Kc/cumulative-irrigation suite, replacing static matplotlib
    PNGs. One shared template: a fixed colorblind-validated categorical order,
    a single-hue blue ramp for magnitude, a blue↔red diverging scale for
    polarity, and reserved status colors for alerts.
  - **Persistent workspace sidebar**: active dataset card with row/column
    counts, one-click CSV download, clear, and demo loading from any page.
  - `plotly>=5.18` added to the `dashboard` extra; `streamlit` floor raised
    to 1.36 (first release with `st.navigation`).
- **Hosted-demo deployment scaffolding**: root `streamlit_app.py` +
  `requirements.txt` for Streamlit Community Cloud one-click deploys, and a
  ready-to-push Hugging Face Space under `deploy/huggingface-space/`
  (closes the "hosted Streamlit demo" roadmap gap, #34).
- **Colorblind-safe palette** (`viz/styles.py`): `apply_aqua_style(palette="colorblind")`
  switches the `axes.prop_cycle` to the Okabe-Ito / Color Universal Design
  8-colour palette. The default behaviour is unchanged. Thanks @sairajkasam
  (#110).
- **Baseflow edge-case tests**: Lyne-Hollick and Eckhardt are now pinned on
  their invariants (baseflow bounded by total flow, BFI in [0, 1], steady-state
  behaviour, filter-parameter boundaries, index preservation with NaNs, and the
  empty-series case). Thanks @widjajs (#112).

### Changed
- `SPIModel` now delegates SPI calculation and classification to
  `climate.indices` instead of maintaining its own divergent gamma fit. SPI
  values and drought classes are consistent across the two entry points; if you
  compared them before, expect small numerical differences from `SPIModel`.
  Thanks @taran-dev4u (#132).
- `.streamlit/config.toml` now pins the dashboard's categorical chart colors
  (`chartCategoricalColors`) so native Streamlit charts match the Plotly theme,
  and disables usage-stats gathering.
- `apply_aqua_style()` now explicitly sets `axes.prop_cycle` to `SERIES_COLOURS`
  on every call (previously the cycle was not set, inheriting Matplotlib's
  default). Visually identical for existing code.
- Documentation: README examples, source counts, and ROADMAP issue links were
  audited and corrected against the actual code, with CI drift guards so the
  counts cannot silently go stale again (#128; CLI command count by
  @navaneethsankar07 in #129). The contributors board is now maintained by the
  all-contributors bot.

### Fixed
- **USGS keyless queries work again.** The collector falls back to the legacy
  REST API when a query runs without an API key, instead of failing. Thanks
  @taran-dev4u (#137).
- **CAMELS-CL records are no longer silently dropped** when catchment attributes
  are missing. NaN from a missed `catchment_attributes.csv` join is truthy, so
  it reached Pydantic validation and the resulting error discarded the whole
  record. NaN now maps to `None` for gauge name, coordinates, and area (#118).
- **Live collectors now work in the in-browser (WASM) demo.** `CachedHTTPClient`
  detects Pyodide/Emscripten and routes requests through `urllib` (patched to
  browser XHR by pyodide-http) instead of httpx's socket transport, which hangs
  in WebAssembly. Verified in-browser: Open-Meteo, USGS, Hub'Eau, UN SDG 6,
  AQUASTAT, Taiwan WRA. CORS-blocked sources fail fast with a clear hint, and
  the Collect page shows a browser-demo banner listing what works.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-07-17

Two new river-discharge sources, France (Hub'Eau) and GRDC, and a repair to how
the CLI advertises and reaches its collectors.

### Added
- **France (Hub'Eau)** (`collectors/france_hubeau.py`): `HubeauHydrometrieCollector`
  collects real-time river water level and discharge from Hub'Eau's Hydrométrie
  API, France's national open hydrometry service. No API key required. Available
  as `aquascope collect --source hubeau_hydrometrie`. Readings are emitted as
  `WaterQualitySample`, following the pattern already established in `usgs.py`.
- **GRDC river discharge** (`collectors/grdc.py`): `GRDCCollector` reaches global
  river discharge without the classic GRDC portal's email request-form gate. Two
  modes: `in_situ` (the curated gauge-station subset published on Zenodo) and
  `satellite` (the RSEG remote-sensing discharge extension published on DaRUS).
  Each reading is tagged with `source_type`, so downstream work such as
  Prediction in Ungauged Basins can filter gauge from satellite. Note that the
  in-situ subset is licensed CC BY-NC 4.0: non-commercial use only, attribution
  required. Available as `aquascope collect --source grdc`, with `--mode`
  selecting `in_situ` (default) or `satellite`.
- **`StreamflowReading` schema** (`schemas/water_data.py`): the canonical record
  for river discharge, carrying `discharge_cms`, `source_type`, and an optional
  `uncertainty_cms` for satellite products. `records_to_xarray()` converts it to
  a `discharge` data variable alongside the existing sample and water-level
  record types.

### Fixed
- **`aquascope list-sources` rendered 8 of 22 sources as blank placeholders.**
  The info table is keyed by `DataSource` value, but the Hub'Eau entry was keyed
  `hubeau_hydrometrie` while its enum value is `france_hubeau`, so the lookup
  never matched. GRDC, EU WFD, Japan MLIT, Korea WAMIS, and India WRIS had no
  entry at all. All now render their region, data types, and endpoint.
- **`GRDCCollector` was unreachable from the CLI.** It was registered in
  `collectors/__init__.py` and documented, but had no `collect` entry, leaving it
  importable from Python only.
- **`japan_mlit` and `korea_wamis` were unreachable from the CLI.** Both were
  already in the collector map but missing from the `--source` choices, so
  argparse rejected them as invalid.

### Notes
- River discharge is currently emitted under two schemas: GRDC uses the new
  `StreamflowReading`, while Hub'Eau and USGS use `WaterQualitySample`.
  Consolidating on `StreamflowReading` is planned and will be a breaking change
  for those collectors when it lands.
- `GRACE` and `USGS_GW` are declared in `DataSource` but have no collector yet,
  and still list without metadata.
- India WRIS is not exposed through `aquascope collect`: its collector requires
  arguments the command does not pass. It remains available from Python.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-10

Groundwater drought: daily Taiwan groundwater data, SGI and SPI drought
indices, and an end-to-end drought-propagation case study.

### Added
- **Worked example** (`examples/13_groundwater_drought_sgi.py`): an end-to-end
  case study, data to result, characterising Taiwan's 2020-2021 groundwater
  drought. AquaScope collects daily groundwater (`TaiwanWRAGroundwaterDailyCollector`)
  and ERA5 rainfall (`OpenMeteoCollector`) for representative aquifers, computes
  SGI and SPI, and reports each aquifer's drought-propagation timescale (7-23
  months) and 2021 drought severity (SGI down to ~-2, severe).
- **Drought indices** (`groundwater/drought.py`, `climate/indices.py`):
  `standardised_groundwater_index()` (SGI, Bloomfield & Marchant 2013: per
  calendar-month non-parametric normal-scores transform) and
  `standardized_precipitation_index()` (SPI, McKee 1993: gamma fit with zero
  handling and configurable accumulation scale), plus `drought_events()` to
  extract runs below a threshold from any standardised index. These make
  groundwater-meteorological drought-propagation analysis (SGI vs SPI lag) a
  first-class AquaScope workflow.
- **Daily Taiwan groundwater** (`collectors/taiwan_wra.py`):
  `TaiwanWRAGroundwaterDailyCollector` reaches the sub-annual (daily)
  groundwater-level series from the WRA gweb HydroInfo portal, which the
  open-data API does not expose (it tops out at annual statistics). Per-well
  records span roughly 2005-2025 (Zhuoshui/Choushui fan back to the late
  1990s). Supports zone aliases, date clipping, and `aggregate="monthly"`
  (the input to a Standardised Groundwater Index) or `"daily"`. Rate-limits
  and caches every request. This unlocks monthly SGI and SPI/SPEI
  drought-propagation analysis on AquaScope-collected data.
- **Well coordinates for daily groundwater**: `TaiwanWRAGroundwaterDailyCollector`
  gains `with_metadata=True` (default), joining the open-data 井況 well-status
  dataset to populate each reading's `location` (TWD97 → WGS84) and
  `well_depth_m`. The gweb station id matches the suffix of the open-data
  `wellidentifier` after `GW` (with a well-name fallback), making the daily
  series spatially complete.

### Changed
- `CachedHTTPClient.post_json()` now sends a JSON body and shares the retry,
  rate-limit, and body-keyed disk-cache behaviour of `get_json()` (previously
  a thin wrapper with no body, retries, or caching).

### Fixed
- `TaiwanWRAGroundwaterDailyCollector` now drops the gweb missing-data sentinel
  (`-9998`) and de-duplicates window overlaps (the portal can return data past
  the requested `endDate`, so the same well-day appeared twice with different
  values; the later window now wins). Previously these leaked into the series.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-26

Interoperability and uncertainty: AquaScope now composes with the scientific-Python
geo stack and reports calibrated uncertainty on model output.

### Added
- **xarray / GeoPandas interop** (`io/interop.py`): `records_to_xarray()` converts
  time-series records to an `xarray.Dataset` (dims `(time, station_id)`, per-parameter
  variables, lat/lon coords); `records_to_geodataframe()` converts point records to a
  `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` (Point geometry, EPSG:4326). Every collector also accepts
  `collect(as_xarray=...)` / `collect(as_geodataframe=...)`. New `[interop]` extra (#70).
- **GR4J quantile prediction intervals** (`models/rainfall_runoff.py`): `predict_quantiles()`
  produces calibrated uncertainty bands via a residual or parameter-ensemble method
  (heteroscedastic option); the deterministic `simulate()` path is unchanged (#77).
- **Probabilistic metrics** (`analysis/metrics.py`): `pinball_loss`, `picp`, `mpiw`,
  `crps_ensemble`, and `crps_from_quantiles` for scoring interval and ensemble
  forecasts (#76).
- **Multi-basin UQ benchmark** (`examples/12_uq_camels_benchmark.py`): GR4J quantile UQ
  across the bundled CAMELS basins with per-basin and aggregate PICP/CRPS and a
  reliability diagram. On the bundled basins the residual method reaches ~0.90
  central-interval coverage against the 0.90 nominal target (#78).
- **Documentation**: an uncertainty-quantification guide and an updated xarray/GeoPandas
  integration guide.

### Changed
- `require()` gains a `group` override so optional-dependency errors point at the
  correct extra (e.g. `[interop]`).
- JOSS paper (`paper.md`) condensed and updated to v0.7.0 with the interop and UQ work.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **GR4J rainfall-runoff model** (`models/rainfall_runoff.py`): conceptual daily rainfall-runoff model with auto-calibration against NSE / KGE / log-NSE objectives (#52). This is the keystone modelling feature that turns AquaScope from a data + statistics toolkit into a simulation tool.
- **Shared model-evaluation metrics** (`analysis/metrics.py`): NSE, KGE, PBIAS, RMSE, and R² in one reusable module for scoring model predictions (#60).
- **GeoJSON export** for the `collect` command's `--format` option (#64).
- **Extreme-events module** (`analysis/extreme_events.py`): frequency analysis for hydrological extremes (annual maxima/minima series, return-period estimation), with type annotations on all public functions.
- **FAO-56 dual crop coefficient** (`agri/crop_water.py`): new Kcb + Ke mode separates basal transpiration from soil evaporation for more accurate crop water demand, alongside the existing single-Kc mode (#22, #49).
- **UKIH smoothed-minima baseflow separation** (`hydrology/baseflow.py`): adds the UK Institute of Hydrology block method (`ukih`) to the existing Eckhardt and Lyne-Hollick filters, exported via the public hydrology API (#43, #48).
- **India WRIS collector** (`collectors/india_wris.py`): river water-level data from India's Water Resources Information System (#15).
- **Dashboard data sources**: AQUASTAT, EU Water Framework Directive, Japan MLIT, Korea WAMIS, and WaPOR are now selectable in the Streamlit Data Collection page (#14).
- **Dashboard analytical pages**: the Streamlit app gains an **Extreme Events** page (block-maxima frequency analysis with return-level curves and bootstrap confidence bands), an **Agricultural Water** page (FAO-56 ET0 plus the single-Kc / dual Kcb+Ke irrigation workflow), and a **Flow Signatures** analysis plus UKIH baseflow option on the Hydrology page. All new pages ship offline demo-data fallbacks so they work without API keys.
- **`penman_monteith_series`** is now re-exported from `aquascope.agri` for daily ET0 over a weather DataFrame.
- **Edge-case tests** for `SoilWaterBalance` auto-irrigation (#35) and for the new modules.

### Fixed
- **Irrigation efficiency leak** (`agri/water_balance.py`): efficiency losses no longer leak into deep percolation, which previously inflated the groundwater-recharge term (#38, #39).
- **Collector HTTP robustness**: the WQP, Japan MLIT, and Korea WAMIS collectors now route every request through the shared `CachedHTTPClient`, so they get retries, rate-limiting, and disk caching like the other collectors. The Japan MLIT and Korea WAMIS collectors previously called a non-existent `client.get()`, which was swallowed by a broad `except` and made them return empty results on every call. A new `CachedHTTPClient.get_text()` method backs the WQP CSV path.
- **Taiwan WRA water level** (`collectors/taiwan_wra.py`): readings now carry station coordinates when the feed provides them (TWD97/WGS84 lat-lon keys) instead of always setting `location=None`.
- **USGS API key** (`collectors/usgs.py`): the collector no longer hard-defaults to the rate-limited `DEMO_KEY`. It reads `api_key=...` or the `USGS_API_KEY` environment variable, and warns before falling back to `DEMO_KEY`.

### Changed
- **Governance and contributor onboarding**: added `MAINTAINERS.md` with area owners, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, all-contributors recognition in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`, a contributor ladder in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and a "Major features" plus "Good first issues" section in `ROADMAP.md`.
- **Test coverage gate** raised from 60% to 70% (`pyproject.toml`); added the first tests for `utils/http_client.py`, plus config tests for the USGS and Taiwan WRA collectors.
- **Documentation accuracy**: data-source count synced to 19 across README, docs, dashboard, and citation metadata; clarified that aggregate/gridded sources (AQUASTAT, SDG 6, WaPOR) use purpose-built record types rather than the unified `water_data` schema.
- **Software citation**: added `CITATION.cff`; bumped version to 0.6.0.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Multi-provider LLM support** (`ai_engine/recommender.py`) — AI recommender now supports **HuggingFace Inference API** (free), **Groq** (free tier), **Ollama** (local), and OpenAI. `PROVIDER_BASE_URLS` and `PROVIDER_MODELS` constants are exported for dashboard consumption. JSON-object response mode enabled only where supported.
- **Dashboard LLM provider picker** — new `_render_llm_config()` UI lets users switch providers with free-tier links (HF + Groq) directly in the Streamlit dashboard.
- **USGS region filter** (`collectors/usgs.py`) — new `bbox` and `max_items` parameters cap paginated requests to a geographic bounding box and total record count. Dashboard exposes 5 preset US region filters (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Southwest) plus custom bbox input.
- **SDG6 country picker** — dashboard Data Collection page replaces free-text ISO3 input with a 50+ country dropdown for the UN SDG 6 source.
- **WQP state picker** — US Water Quality Portal source now has a full US state dropdown in the dashboard.
- **Taiwan Civil IoT date filtering** (`collectors/taiwan_civil_iot.py`) — `start_date` / `end_date` parameters build OData `phenomenonTime` filter clauses automatically.
- **Dashboard source hints** — Taiwan WRA (level + reservoir) sources now show informational banners clarifying snapshot-only APIs; Taiwan MOENV exposes a record-count slider.

### Fixed
- **GEMStat collector** (`collectors/gemstat.py`) — completely rewritten: now downloads, caches, and parses the GEMStat Zenodo ZIP archive (~200 MB, cached to `data/cache/` after first call). Supports `country`, `parameters`, `start_date`, and `end_date` filtering. Previously returned only file metadata.
- **Taiwan WRA Reservoir collector** (`collectors/taiwan_wra.py`) — field names updated to match current API response format (lowercase keys: `reservoirname`, `dwl`, `inflow`, `outflow`, `capacity`, `nwlmax`). Storage percentage now computed from `capacity / nwlmax`.
- **Dashboard navigation** (`dashboard/app.py`) — fixed `StreamlitAPIException` caused by writing to a widget-bound `current_page` key after the radio widget was already instantiated. Navigation now uses a `_nav_pending` staging key applied before widget creation.
- **Viz backend guard** (`viz/styles.py`) — `_save_or_show()` no longer calls `plt.show()` when using the non-interactive Agg backend (eliminates `FigureCanvasAgg is non-interactive` warnings in CI and headless environments).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-01
