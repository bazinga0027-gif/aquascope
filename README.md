AquaScope unifies **30 global water-data sources** behind one Python schema, then layers a full scientific computing stack on top — from **Bulletin 17C flood frequency** to **FAO-56 crop water requirements** — wrapped in an AI engine that scores **26 research methodologies** against your dataset and auto-executes **26 analysis pipelines**. Validated against the CAMELS benchmark with 1,000+ tests.

---

## 🌍 Try it without installing anything

**[AquaScope Explorer](https://rekin226-aquascope-explorer.static.hf.space/)**: every public gauge we can reach on one map
(45,919 stations from USGS, UK EA, Hub'Eau, PEGELONLINE, Ireland OPW and Taiwan CWA). Click one and get the observed record,
flood frequency with confidence limits, flow duration and trend, computed in your browser by aquascope on Pyodide.
The catalog behind it is an open GeoParquet dataset, [`Rekin226/aquascope-gauges`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Rekin226/aquascope-gauges), harvested weekly.
Press **Ask ✨** to type a question in plain language (bring your own key, Groq and Hugging Face are free): the model picks the
tools, aquascope runs them in your browser, and the answer ends with the data used and the methods with citations.
Press **Study** (or "Study this place" on any gauge or point) to hand a whole problem to a crew of roles: it writes the
brief with you, inventories the data in reach and the table you drop in, proposes a methodology you approve, runs it with
a check after every step, and hands back a zip with a Word report, an Excel workbook, PNG and SVG figures, a notebook that
re-runs the study and the study.yaml. Keyless it still does all of that from the playbooks; your own key puts a model
behind every role ([docs](docs/studio.md)).
Not a Python user? The same files open in [R, QGIS, DuckDB and Julia](docs/readers.md) in place; `integrations/qgis/` has a
drag-and-drop layer definition.

Prefer an assistant? `pip install "aquascope[mcp]"` then `claude mcp add aquascope -- aquascope mcp` gives Claude (or any
MCP client) `find_stations`, `get_timeseries`, `analyze_station` and `flood_frequency` over the same catalog and methods
([docs](docs/mcp.md)).

## ✨ What you can do

- 🌊 **Pull water data** from USGS, FAO AQUASTAT, FAO WaPOR, GEMStat, EU WFD, Copernicus ERA5, France Hub'Eau, Taiwan MOENV/WRA/Civil IoT/DataGov, Japan MLIT, Korea WAMIS, India WRIS, South Africa DWS, GRDC, CAMELS-CL, OpenMeteo, UN SDG 6, US Water Quality Portal — **one unified Python API**.

---

## 🚀 Examples

### 1. Flood frequency analysis (Bulletin 17C)

```python
from aquascope.api import flood_analysis

result = flood_analysis(daily_discharge, method="gev", return_periods=[10, 50, 100])
print(result.return_periods)
# {10: 1840.2, 50: 2530.7, 100: 2870.4}
print(result.confidence_intervals)
# {10: (1690.4, 2010.6), 50: (2280.1, 2820.9), 100: (2540.6, 3260.5)}
```

Switch `method` to `"lp3"`, `"gumbel"`, `"gev_lmoments"`, or `"gpd"`. Non-stationary GEV (`fit_nonstationary_gev`) and Bulletin 17C EMA for censored records (`expected_moments_algorithm`) are available in `aquascope.hydrology.flood_frequency`.

### 2. Baseflow separation + hydrological signatures

```python
from aquascope.api import baseflow_analysis, compute_all_signatures

bf  = baseflow_analysis(daily_discharge, method="eckhardt")   # or "lyne_hollick"
sig = compute_all_signatures(daily_discharge)

print(bf.bfi)                  # baseflow index, e.g. 0.42
print(sig.q5, sig.q95)         # high-flow / low-flow exceedances
print(sig.flashiness_index)    # Richards-Baker flashiness index
```

22 signatures across magnitude, variability, timing, recession, and flashiness — see [docs/features.md](docs/features.md#hydrological-analysis).

### 3. Collect data from any of the 30 sources

```python
from aquascope import find_stations
from aquascope.collectors import USGSCollector, AquastatCollector, WaPORCollector

# Which gauges measure discharge around Greater London? (USGS, UK EA, Hub'Eau,
# PEGELONLINE, Ireland OPW and Taiwan CWA expose station catalogs; more coming)
gauges = find_stations(bbox=(-0.5, 51.3, 0.3, 51.7), variable="discharge")
print(gauges[0].name, gauges[0].url)

usgs = USGSCollector()   # pass api_key=... for reliable access
flow = usgs.collect(days=7, bbox="-77.6,38.7,-76.9,39.1")   # Potomac basin, last week

aquastat = AquastatCollector()
egy_water = aquastat.collect(country_code="EGY", variable_ids=[4263, 4253, 4312])

wapor = WaPORCollector()
et = wapor.collect(
    bbox=(30.5, 29.8, 31.1, 30.2),
    variable="RET",
    start_date="2026-04-01",
    end_date="2026-07-31",
)
```

Every collector returns records in the **same Pydantic schema**, so downstream analyses don't care where the data came from. See [docs/data_sources.md](docs/data_sources.md) for the full list.

### 4. FAO-56 crop water requirements + soil water balance

```python
from datetime import date
from aquascope.agri import (
    penman_monteith_daily,
    crop_water_requirement,
    SoilWaterBalance,
)
from aquascope.agri.water_balance import SoilProperties

# Reference ET (FAO-56 Penman-Monteith) — Cairo, July
eto = penman_monteith_daily(
    t_min=18.0, t_max=32.0, rh_min=40, rh_max=80,
    u2=2.0, rs=22.0, latitude=30.0, elevation=70, doy=180,
)

# Crop water requirement for maize from planting through harvest — eto_series is
# a daily ET₀ pd.Series (build one with penman_monteith_series on a weather DataFrame)
cwr = crop_water_requirement(eto_series, crop="maize", planting_date=date(2026, 4, 1))

# Soil water balance with auto-irrigation triggers — returns a daily DataFrame
soil    = SoilProperties(field_capacity=0.30, wilting_point=0.15, root_depth=1.0)
balance = SoilWaterBalance(soil).auto_irrigate(
    cwr["etc"], precip_series, efficiency=0.7,
)
print(balance["irrigation_mm"].sum())             # total irrigation applied (mm)
print(int(balance["irrigation_trigger"].sum()))   # number of deficit days
```

Notebook tutorial: [agricultural water demand and irrigation scheduling](notebooks/07_agricultural_water_demand.ipynb).

### 5. AI methodology recommender

```python
from aquascope.ai_engine import DatasetProfile, recommend

# Describe your dataset and goal — get ranked, scored methodologies
profile = DatasetProfile(
    parameters=["DO", "BOD5", "COD"],
    n_records=4_500,
    time_span_years=6.0,
    research_goal="detect long-term pollution trends with seasonality",
)
recs = recommend(profile)

for r in recs[:3]:
    print(f"{r.score:5.1f}  {r.methodology.id:<18}  {r.rationale[:46]}…")
#  55.9  trend_analysis      Your dataset includes bod5, cod, do which are…
#  54.6  lstm_forecasting    Your dataset includes bod5, cod, do which are…
#  54.6  arima_forecast      Your dataset includes bod5, cod, do which are…
```

Then auto-execute the top result with `run_pipeline(recs[0].methodology.id, df)`.

### 6. Change-point detection + copula dependence

```python
from aquascope.api import detect_changepoints, fit_copula

cps  = detect_changepoints(annual_runoff, method="pettitt")
cop  = fit_copula(rainfall, runoff, family="auto")    # AIC-selects Gaussian/Clayton/Gumbel/Frank
cp   = cps.changepoints[0]
print(cp.timestamp, cp.p_value)
print(cop.family, cop.parameter, cop.aic)
```

### 7. Bayesian regression with uncertainty quantification

```python
from aquascope.api import bayesian_regression

# Annual rainfall → runoff with full posterior + convergence diagnostics
posterior = bayesian_regression(X=annual_precip, y=annual_runoff)

print(posterior.posterior_mean)
# {'beta_0': 12.4, 'beta_1': 0.82, 'sigma2': 41.6}

print(posterior.credible_intervals["beta_1"])
# (0.78, 0.86)        ← 95% credible interval on slope

print(posterior.r_hat)
# {'beta_0': 1.00, 'beta_1': 1.00, 'sigma2': 1.00}    ← Gelman–Rubin, converged

print(posterior.dic, posterior.effective_sample_size["beta_1"])
# 124.7  9842.0       ← model fit + effective sample size
```

Switch to MCMC with `degree>1` for polynomial models, or pass `prior_precision` for informative priors. Conjugate linear, polynomial, and Metropolis-Hastings backends are all available.
