"""The Collect page must not submit a form the collector will reject (#174).

The forms only write a fetch kwarg when the user typed something, so a blank
required field used to reach the collector as a missing argument and surface as
a raw ``ValueError`` -- for PEGELONLINE, ``station_id must not be empty.``
These tests pin the guard that stops that, and the guard's own coverage.
